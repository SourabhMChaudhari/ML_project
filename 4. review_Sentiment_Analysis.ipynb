Also, a good caffeinated alternative to coffee.\n","neutral\n","The first couple times I used it I thougth it was okay.....nothing to write home about but added something tasty to my water.  The next few times I used it I couldn't stand it and dumped out my glass and went back to drinking just plain water.  I do not drink tea all the time but every once in awhile I have a craving for sweet tea and I wanted a healthy version of it.....or something close.  This is not it!!  There is a taste to it that is hard to explain that becomes more and more evident the more you add....it's not a good taste....maybe you could call it a chemical taste.  This is the only flavor I have ever tried from Mio and I will not be using the rest of it or buying it again.  Definitely did NOT fulfill my craving for sweet tea.\n","neutral\n","Taste is good, she likes it very much. We feel its healthy for her and easy to digest.

We've tried many flavored olive oils, including locally produced, and these are the best!  Each flavor is unique & has a place in our family cuisine.  The orange is our all-time favorite.  We use it for cooking French toast & drizzling over a variety of sweet rolls or breads.  Amazing for dipping (try it swirled with honey).  Other flavors are also great for dipping various breads, crackers, even rice cakes, for cooking eggs, etc, or for pouring over foods -- except for the red pepper, which we don't care for as much.\n","neutral\n","My favorite!\n","positive\n","Tastewise it is decent product but contains carageenan which I just found out.<br />Will not purchase again.\n","neutral\n","Love the flavor, but also for the health conscious, it's an excellent way to control how much sodium is in your snack food.\n","neutral\n","PERFECT!\n","positive\n","DELICIOUS!\n","positive\n","Love this pasta\n","positive\n","Purchased this item for my grandson, he absolutely loves them.

Leaves an orangy color on the popcorn just like the theater popcorn.\n","neutral\n","It arrived from amazon and I was worried because it was bright red and very strong.  I used 2 tablespoons, 1 can coconut cream, put chopped onion, sliced carrot, sliced green pepper, and some baby corn.  Added some coriander, minced garlic and ginger root.  Put 1.5 cups water on top and stirred in the crock pot.  Boiled 2 chicken breasts 20 mins.  Added the chicken to the crock pot and cooked on high for 2 hours.  OOoooh your house will smell amazing and the curry turns a gorgeous hue of yellow.  The flavors will astound you and your dinner mates.  Rich, deep flavors.  Savory sauce sticks to rice and it isn't too spicy and far from lackluster.\n","neutral\n","Just an average blend without robust flavor and flat finish. A fair blend and worth the money.I'm looking for a more robust coffee with a smooth, not bitter, finish.\n","neutral\n","Good stuff and no citric acid either. Especially since I'm allergic to citrus. Citric acid is made from citrus.\n","neutral\n","By the time they arrive they're dry and unappealing (melted & refrozen mess) wouldn't buy again.\n","neutral\n","Not only is the citrus flavor very strong, so is the sea salt itself.

You can't go wrong with WW chocolate\n","neutral\n","Gimbal's Sugar Free Cherry Chews are bite-sized, soft, and chewy, and have a pleasant, distinct, but not overpowering cherry flavor. They're great as an afternoon snack and are one of my favorite sugar-free treats. These sugar-free chews are sweetened with maltitol, sorbitol and sucralose. (So, enjoy in moderation, since excessive consumption may have a laxative effect.) All Gimbals products are Kosher (&#34;OU&#34; pareve) and are nut free, transfat free, gelatin free, gluten free, dairy free, and egg free.\n","neutral\n","Started the Paleo diet 2 weeks back and was looking for a natural unrefined salt.

It's very high quality and lasts for quite a while in the refrigerator without going bad, which I've heard it can do.  Would/will buy again.\n","neutral\n","Wow!!! Let me start by saying I love tea, so when I was able to try this I was excited. I did not know much about Matcha so I did my research before it came. I was thrilled when I got an e-recipe book that gave me tons of ways to incorporate this Matcha into everyday recipes. Still my favorite way is to add 2 tablespoons of powder to a hot cup of water, and a touch of honey. I also love the energy I get from it, as well as the other benefits. This is a new staple in my pantry.\n","neutral\n","I was looking for a great tea blend that I could make cold that was not the normal brown/black tea. I found this tea on Amazon and I am hooked. Green tea is supposed to help with the digestive system and weight loss and it has zero calories so it allows me to drink more water without adding any calories. I have a water infusion water bottle so I add lemon and cucumber to the bottle then once this tea is prepared I add it to the bottle and it takes wonderful! I have been drinking it non stop for 3 days and I have been able to drink 1/2 of my body weight in water which I hope will assist with weight loss. If they make more cold brewed flavors I may try those as well. It is  a winner for me!\n","neutral\n","By the time they arrive they're dry and unappealing wouldn't buy again.\n","neutral\n","Good value if you buy with enough products for larger discount.

The size and plumpness were more than satisfactory and the flavor was very clearly fresh. These are not salted or roasted; if you want that, then you can certainly do it yourself. Otherwise, they make lovely snacking right out of the bag or can be used in cooking. I only wish the bag they ship in could be recloseable. I recommend these nuts to anybody who likes cashews. I'll definitely be buying more of these when I run out.\n","neutral\n","Best way to stock up arrives at your door, definite cost savings!\n","neutral\n","Love the breakfast blend.

The price is nuts, but I save by using Subscribe and Save, and by making one cup at a time, it never tastes burnt or stale.\n","neutral\n","I was apprehensive ordering these almonds because of some of the reviews, but because of the price I went ahead and ordered a bag.  I'm sure glad I did!  They taste great and they do come in a zipper bag (even though it's not easy to zip).  I bought these mainly for making almond milk since that's what I use on my cereal and in my coffee (don't drink milk). I've made two batches of almond milk so far and it tastes good, plus less expensive than buying it.  We also eat the almonds right out of the bag.<br /><br />Right after receiving the first bag we liked them so much I ended up ordering two more bags!  The price went up and when it dropped I ordered another three bags!  I'll be able to make lots of almond milk, and now my husband is addicted to almonds.  :-)<br /><br />Almonds last longer in the refrigerator or freezer so I started putting them in the refrigerator and in a sealed container.\n","neutral\n","Yum!\n","neutral\n","this is what I AM LOOKING FOR\n","neutral\n","This is my favorite popcorn, and amazon is the only place I could find it.

When I saw &#34;Rock Hot Chili Squid &#34; flavored chips on the Amazon site ( to quote a very old ad slogan) I let my fingers do the walking and one-clicked my way to expectant  nirvana. You see, none of my local grocery stores carries  the variety of Lay's flavors available on Amazon.  Alas,  when the package arrived and I dove into the chips, I was sorely disappointed.  They ARE  spicy but  not to the degree that &#34;hot chili&#34; is an accurate descriptive term and the nearest a squid got to these chips was when one of them swam by .a cruise liner some Lay's employees may have been on.\n","neutral\n","My fiance and I love cooking with this stuff...even though people say not to.  All of the hard, tangible evidence says you can cook with it just as long as you aren't burning at 350 degrees+ for 60 min+.\n","neutral\n","This was as expected and arrived quickly\n","neutral\n","This is a great product. I bought it to use as coffee creamer because I have a hard time using up a container of fresh before it spoils and love that it creams the coffee without weakening or cooling it and without the chemicals of nondairy creamer, but am using it for hot cereal and cooking as well. Coffee shops should offer this as alternative creamer to half-n-half and nondairy.\n","neutral\n","It was popular when i was giving away the kit kats, but some were more popular than others.

My only issue, is that , in my entire bag there wasn't a single whole piece. Every piece was broken. Very hard to count calories and carbs when you have to piece it together.  I will order again, and hopefully this time, it wont be a bag of puzzle pieces. :)\n","neutral\n","Very good; excellent value.  We will use dried 'shroms over fresh every time.  More flavor and always available w/o running to the store.\n","neutral\n","I took them to work for my lunches so I didn't have to worry about everyone using a jar of Mayo sitting in the fridge. I've also taken them along on a lake trip and camping. Very convenient.\n","neutral\n","If you like SpaghettiOs, these are a nice portioned snack size. I'm pretty ambivalent on them, I've eaten them when I wanted something quick, but buy them primarily for my family as a guilty pleasure convenience food.<br /><br />The sauce seems a little thicker than the canned sauce, but it's very soupy. I suggest a handful of saltines if you want to get all the tomato sauce out of it. The flavor just as sweet as the original and the Os did not turn mushy in the microwave, like the canned the Os are very soft. It doesn't cook any quicker than canned on the stove, but there is less cleanup.<br /><br />Snack, not meal sized. Although you could fill it out with other things to make a lunch by putting half a sandwich and maybe a small salad on the side.<br /><br />My family reuses these kinds of microwave trays to hold glue, paint or water in crafts, and if you have a place nearby that takes higher number plastic recyclables- it can be recycled.\n","neutral\n","I received this tea in a sampler package, and the aroma completely intrigued everyone at my office.  It has a delicious berry aroma but it's not sweet or tart.  I'm ordering a full package of this now.\n","neutral\n","tasty\n","neutral\n","These taste great, and when I want a little crunchy snack, I've been grabbing these instead of chips or the regular version of these thinables.

I did not have any problems with 'clumping'.  They're gummy candies, umm... they stick together.  Not sure why that would be an issue.<br /><br />The prices is good, reasonable.<br /><br />The taste is excellent.<br /><br />I love when supplements come in gummy form.  I don't eat candy, so gummies are fun for me.  Love them.<br /><br />When I initially found these, I was searching for something to take with me on run days.  I came across these.  I'd read a lot about collagen, and had wanted to try it.  These are perfect.<br /><br />The number one ingredient is apple juice.  They do contain corn syrup which I tend to avoid when I can, so that would be the only drawback.  50% Vitamin C per serving.  10 mg sodium.  11 g sugar.<br /><br />contains 1,000 mg Kosher Fish Collagen.<br />If you're looking for a great way to get your collagen on, this is it.\n","neutral\n","Great item- good base for pineapple upside down cake as well as chocolate cake/cupcakes!\n","neutral\n","My son and his wife served these at his wedding and they are delicious. They are all natural fruit drink with effervescence. I like this clementine flavor - it's a fresh, light citrus flavor. It has 19g of natural fruit sugar per serving, so you may want to mix it with seltzer if you are watching your sugar intake. It's a light, healthy beverage which will appeal to many.\n","neutral\n","This has been a great product for adding to milk.\n","neutral\n","Good as a spaghetti sauce.  Tasty, but not so good as a marinara sauce.\n","neutral\n","Historically I used SOS regularly for any run post 7 miles. I am very sensitive--prone to quick dehydration and allergic to sugar so SOS is the only drink on the market that works for me, preventing dehydration, muscle cramps and headaches.  Last week during my run my arm swelled up and I was rushed to the hospital; the end result was a blood clot as a result of a sports injury.  The blood thinners the doctor put me on is dehydrating me and causing severe cramping/pain.  I remembered that SOS essentially works like an IV. I have been drinking 2 a day and it completely relieved the cramping.\n","neutral\n","Yum! These are very good! Exactly what I wanted.

The aroma is a bit exaggerated.\n","neutral\n","Way way overpriced and poor quality. You will definately get much better steaks at your local grocery.\n","neutral\n","Great coffee! All had good flavor. I didn't notice any grounds in the cup, or a difference in taste from one k-cup to the next (of the same flavor). I was looking for some good coffee to keep at work, and decided to take a chance on this variety pack. I took the chance mainly on the fun names and the reviews it was getting. Definitely glad I went with this coffee! My top 3 were Vanilla Skyline, Oh Fudge, and Coney Island Caramel.<br />I was a little disappointed in the &#34;variety&#34; of the variety pack. Cinnamon Subway, which was one of my least favorite (still a great cup of coffee, just not a huge fan of cinnamon myself), seemed to dominate the selection I got along with Hazelnut. My favorite, Vanilla Skyline, only had 3 total I believe. Not enough of a gripe to dock it a star, but hopefully my next order will contain a little less cinnamon! :)\n","neutral\n","These are wonderful. My morning cappuccino has never tasted better.

Super refreshing, tasty, and a great afternoon pick-me-up. I definitely recommend it!\n","positive\n","Nice flavor. Not gluten free, though.\n","neutral\n","I buy this whole flax seed because when ground, it stays fresher than grinding in bulk. Every morning, I use a couple tablespoons in my oatmeal to the cereal and gives it somewhat of a nutty taste. Four bags last a long time and the product is always fresh and sealed well. It's a good idea to either refrigerate or freeze ground seeds when it's not immediately used.\n","neutral\n","I have not gotten these from this seller, but I have eaten Tampico Freezer Pops a few years back. I have looked and looked at stores around me for them and can not find them any more. They are DELICIOUS!!  As far as &#34;figuring out how to open&#34; them....I used a knife and cut about a half inch from the little center of the pop. Prop the other half up and then eat that when you are finished with the first one. Not that hard.\n","neutral\n","I put a spoon of this in my morning fruit smoothies.

EVER! Okay so I just want to start by saying if you love BBQ style smells and sauces, this is the sea salt for you. All you have to do is open the jar and the smell hits you. You can be on the other side of the room and smell it. It is that strong. Plus you can actually taste the flavor when you use it, unlike some sea salts. My entire family loves it. I do not want to run out any time soon but when I do I will definitely be ordering more.\n","neutral\n","If you are acne prone buy these.

Just make sure you rinse with water as instructed on container ( which somehow I didn't read it and I was wondering why I was breaking out) ok well first time I bought these I thought you wipe your face with pad and done. NO. YOU MUST RINSE YOUR FACE OFF WITH WATER AFTER USE. Well I didn't and I was like ok this is another product that doesn't work and made me think it made my face worst. So I stopped using them. So my son started breaking out and I knew I wasn't gonna use them so I gave them to him to try and his face cleared right. WHAT? yea weird so I thought I give it another try and this time (Don't know why I didn't read the first time) I read it and lord be hold it said to rinse face after with water  boom ah ha moment I didn't it 3 times a day and within a week or so my face cleared up it does dry your skin so moisturize.

I then found the Endangered Species version at Whole Foods. Wow, huge difference in quality and flavor. The mint is so subtle, you have to really let this dark chocolate melt in your mouth slowly before you notice the mint flavor. Plus, this brand's dark chocolate mint is 72% cocoa instead of just 47% on the Lindt brand. Highly highly recommended if you love dark chocolate with added flavor.\n","neutral\n","I have only used this once.

I was slightly put off when I first tried them thinking I made a 5lb mistake, because fresh from the package, they have this odd sort of aroma and taste - must be something they treat the gumball with before shipping. ...like gumball shiner or something.  That dissipates quickly especially if you leave out small pile in a candy dish.<br />The shell is just hard enough to be ...perfect. It make you exert just enough effort to make the reward that much sweeter.  I can't get enough of this gum although the 5lbs of it make it last quite a while - that said, I get through it in about two weeks.  The gum part doesn't last long, but this is a gumball not a piece of Stride gum.  A true gumball fanatic/connoisseur knows the best part is busting through the shell the first time, pulverizing it, then moving on to another gumball.  over and over again.<br />The smaller size of these also makes them perfect for filling up your mouth too with 4 or 5 of them.  The Orange and lemon ones are the softest and more flavorful.  Greens and reds have harder shells and the reds seems to outnumber the others.  Greens with the odd shape have a flavor all their own.  It's best to chew greens with other greens - just a tip.<br />Seriously, I so want to the company and try and buy a 20lb or 50lb box of these - they are really that good.\n","neutral\n","This is an incredibly floral treat. If you're not into strong floral flavors, this won't be your thing. But if you love the delicate taste of rose accompanied with a very finely made Turkish delight, this is definitely the treat for you. The package arrived wrapped in plastic to help control the powdered sugar in the box, and another slide out tray within the box holding the treats. The quality of the candy itself is high quality as well. They have just the right consistency for a fine treat, not too gummy and not too firm and are conveniently cut into 1 inch cubes for rationing it among friends (or keeping it to yourself!) Overall, a very high quality Turkish Delight that has very strong floral flavors and a great texture.\n","neutral\n","Too many packages for our size family...\n","neutral\n","The product is good but the price is not.

Ghee helps ladies in pregnancy keep the stomach &#34;lubricated&#34; (esp. since my wife had hemorhhoids). The product is awesome n the packing is very very perfect.<br />Its tasty to have with pulses (pigeon peas, etc.). Instead of oil one should use this regularly. We even use it to on the tortillas.<br /><br />We ordered it in the sweltering heat of texas yet the ghee did not melt away (which was a big concern to me).<br />The only reasons why i have given it 4 stars and not 5 is because:-<br />1. No product can touch 5 ever. (every product has flaws as all humans have flaws).<br />2. There is no option of speedy delivery.\n","neutral\n","I'm Chilean. This was the first time I tried salmiakki, just out of curiosity after reading a BBC article about it, and I loved it!<br />The salty taste can be quite shocking at first, but when you get used to it you just want more! Little by little, you start noticing other secondary flavors coming from underneath the dominant saltiness. With this pack you have the opportunity to try three different versions of salmiakki. It seems to me that Pantteri is the strongest in the pack, with a salty menthol taste. My favorite was Super Salmiakki, which leaves a pleasant salty sugar cane flavor in your mouth. It's weird, but nice. For a Chilean consumer, I'd describe it as &#34;salty chancaca&#34;. But I must say that the saltiness in salmiakki is not the same as in cooking salt. Ammonium chloride is different from sodium chloride. If you enjoy some salty treats like crisps or Doritos, you won't have problems with salmiakki. Just beware of your blood pressure!!<br />All in all, I'll be back soon buying some more!!\n","neutral\n","I have to admit I am partial to Sid Wainer & Son. When I visit yearly the NRA (National Restaurant Association) show in Chicago, the biggest in the restaurant industry, I always make sure to stop by Sid Wainer & Son booth because it's the best in the show! everything they offer is of outstanding quality. I'm very pleased to say that what they offer on Amazon is of the same top quality. The grilled artichokes and the Tuscan antipasto are to die for!

Tastes like Hot Cocoa, if you're looking for making a hot cup of cocoa, without sugar, use some liquid stevia and add some milk (substitute) and it's delicious!  You don't have to destroy the nutritional base of the cacao, just add the milk to the cacao first (1/2 cup) and then add the other (1/2 cup of hot water) it turns into a 'warm' cacao, but doesn't destroy the properties of the cacao.  Also, add cinnamon for a delicious and health beneficial additive!<br />Cacao is the highest source of magnesium from a whole food and isn't used near as much as it should be.  Magnesium relaxes muscles, and dissolve plaque build up in the arteries reversing heart diseases and naturally lowering blood pressure.  It is great for weight loss because it has high chromium, regulates blood sugar, and just great for the cardiovascular system as a whole.<br />If you do not heat it and consume it raw, there's even more benefits from the antioxicants, as well as the preservation of vitamin C, which is destroyed with any heating process. (Makes you re-think the benefits of any orange juice that hasn't been juiced right in front of your eyes.)<br />It has a great source of phenethylamine which is a feel good neurotransmitter, it has high Omega 6 fatty acids which also aid in the absorption of nutrients and benefit the cardiovascular system.

Just the looks alone that you get from coworkers and family members when you start eating the peanuts, shell and all, right out of the bag are worth the price!! But aside from the sheer entertainment value of these Jerky.com World Famous Deep Fried Peanuts, they are also quite tasty! I like the Spicy Hot(not really all that spicy) and the Simply Salted ones best. They are addictive! The texture is not what you would expect... when the peanuts are deep fried in the shells, it seems to break down the woody and fibrous texture of  the shell, so that they just disintegrate into a mouthful of peanuty crunchy delight when you chomp down on their salty goodness! If you haven't yet had the pleasure, I highly recommended them as a wonderfully different food sensation.

Seven hours later at work, and I can STILL smell this soap faintly on my skin.  At first I thought it was a bit strong as I took it out of the wrapper, but it feels wonderful on my skin and I changed my mind about the scent.  Very sandlewood-ish and lightly patchouli-ish.  I wish it had more of a patchouli scent, but honestly, it didn't take me but a few minutes in the shower to determine that I love this soap.  The smell brought me awake and I felt really clean.  I'm a fan of the Pre de Provence soap...particularly the Linden variety, but I think I prefer THIS soap.  I will definitely be ordering more and in bigger quantity.  (Also, I took the bar out of the shower and let it dry so that kids showering, etc would not waste it unnecessarily).  Extreme fast shipping.  Extremely satisfied.\n","neutral\n","Our assortment of three 1.2 ounce glass bottles came very well packaged.

I love hemp because of the fiber content.  A lot of people slam hemp because of its low protein content (11g) per comparable serving of whey at 20g bit on a gram-for-gram basis the amino acid comparison is better (I feel) for hemp.  It contains 2X the arginine of whey.  It is lower in leucine but I always add extra pure leucine powder (which I purchase off Amazon) to most of my drinks anyway.  Hemp does have a little but of a grassy taste but it makes the extra leucine blend much easier and it has NO AFTERTASTE.  I am saddened it is never mentioned in ANY of the fitness magazines  as an alternative protein source.  I find the taste is better with fruit juice which I usually water it down half and half.  On the downside, hemp need to be kept in the refrigerator or freezer.\n","neutral\n","My favorite of all the kale chips.

I used this for my skin and my hair. It is solid in the jar but quickly melts into a clear liquid oil in the palm of your hand. It's easy to apply and does not leave a gooey mess on one's skin. The scent of coconut doesn't linger very long but while it does it reminds me of laying on the beach getting a tan. My hair is a bit on the flyaway side when it air dries. With a light coating of the coconut oil on my palms I applied it to my hair and it helped my hair stay in place better.

Even community k-cups taste better....\n","neutral\n","Makes a perfect &#34;Thany you&#34; present for that tea drinker person\n","neutral\n","I jus love these iand i got my mother-in-law hooked so i ned more.\n","neutral\n","This is great-tasting honey.  Back for more....\n","neutral\n","Yep it's jelly !\n","positive\n","Love these crackers\n","positive\n","I bought this becuase its sugar free; all taste good, I just had to get used to the &#34;liquidy&#34; state. Its not syrupy. This is an excellent ingrediant/recipe for my bariactric weight loss needs, especially the CHOCOLATE syrup!\n","neutral\n","It's about a C  in taste. Not as good as I expected and kind of runny.\n","neutral\n","One of the packages of seasoning had a hole  in the back of it, large enough to leak seasoning into the box.  It is too much trouble to return the dozen packages when 11 of them are just fine, but the economy of purchasing in bulk was annoyingly diminished by not being able to use one the packages. It would be nice to be credited with 1/12 of the price, but I can't figure out how to ask for that.\n","neutral\n","This is the vanilla oreo cookies, but the center is a little different than what it normally is, the creamy center is watermelon, a little fruity and sweet. It is worth a try and is a good flavor.\n","neutral\n","Product looked exactly as advertised.  Was shipped promptly via fed ex.  Very moist and flavorful loaded with coconut.  It was like home made fresh from the kitchen.  Did not taste, look, or feel like commercial factory made cookies. Trader Joe and Whole Foods quality.  Hard to have just one!  I highly suggest trying it, especially for you coconut lovers.  Good stuff!!\n","neutral\n","QUICK SHIPPING. ITEM JUST AS DESCRIBED! THANKS!\n","neutral\n","These were just as delicious as regular tortillas.\n","neutral\n","Stated they were for keurig Vue machine so I ordered 2 boxes and they don't fit the machine.  Now I'm stuck with 80 unusable kcups. Description was very misleading\n","neutral\n","As advertised\n","neutral\n","Love the bottled ones. I can no longer find these at the stores. You can still find them at restaurants, though. But, prefers the bottle ones in my home.\n","neutral\n","This tastes just like its full sugar version. I make these all the time and no one ever knows the difference. In fact everyone is shocked when I tell them the brownies are sugar free.\n","neutral\n","great taste, great value!\n","positive\n","Good soup, easy lunch with pull top opener.

The coffee tastes great and they don't use the little plastic cup on the bottom so their is less waste. The cost is also way better than most of the other brands that fit in the Keurig.\n","neutral\n","they are great .\n","positive\n","Great coffee\n","positive\n","I love this coffee.  You can actually taste the chocolate.  My experience with Kcups has been that the flavored varieties aren't full bodied but this one comes very very close.\n","neutral\n","great tea\n","positive\n","I wanted to love this bar...I did.  I eat other Larabar's all the time and eat clean so it isn't like I'm not used to \\\\\"healthier\\\\\" bars.  It is the peppermint extract that did it in for me.  It is so strong and almost tastes like alcohol.  Not something I'm looking for in my treats sadly.\n","neutral\n","I like this as a sugar substitute and use in my coffee everyday. I have used  it in baking and it works well.\n","neutral\n","As good as fresh off the cob... No kidding! Good to throw into 'Dinty Moore' beef stew as a 'gussie up', or whatever.\n","neutral\n","Not sure what the flavor is supposed to be - average at best\n","neutral\n","My mare loves it! She has been wearing it down quicker than I thought she would but we have been going through a heat wave and I'm glad it is encouraging her to drink. The salt is great quality and a good value for the size. I'm very pleased with this product-just ordered another to make sure I always have one on hand for my girl.\n","neutral\n","Great light water!!!\n","positive\n","I love this GLUTEN FREE hard candy!  I have Celiac so it is so hard to find any kind of candy to eat and this is awesome!  I love anything orange flavored so this is a treat for me.  I used to buy it locally but when the store stopped carrying it, I was able to come to Amazon to order it!  It is not cheap but the &#34;price&#34; I pay to eat unsafe food and get sick as a result is far greater a burden to my body than buying this AWESOME candy is to my budget.\n","neutral\n","pretty good\n","positive\n","just like a Japanese restaurant taste and so easy to prepare, my sister goes through a bag a month!\n","neutral\n","I picked up the throat lozenge version, and it helps me a lot in the gym!

I remember having them as a child, but Cherry is so hard to come by!  Those other cherry by Twizzlers have a different taste and I don't care for it.\n","neutral\n","Love it!<br />I love to strain the kefir every day. My kefir grains grow so much now. I am using organic milk and everybody loves to drink the kefir in my household. I wish I could have access to buy raw milk but  here in Maryland is illegal to sale it. Just ridicule. Almost everybody grows up with raw milk in the past, a lot healthier option now not available to our kids or grand-kids.\n","neutral\n","I've tried several different brands of coffee and settled on this one as my favorite.\n","neutral\n","This is good popcorn.  I had been getting the 2 1/2 oz. size, but decided if I was going to share with anyone, I would have to go bigger.  It always gets to me quickly and it's always been fresh.\n","neutral\n","bought these on reoccurring monthly subscription - not the freshest!  Same issue with the Box of larger bars.\n","neutral\n","I use my vinegar for everything - rinse hair was why I bought it.  I'm loving it.\n","neutral\n","These are delicious!\n","positive\n","These didn't make it past the first day, LOL! Organic ingredients and EXCELLENT flavor, what's not to like?! Well actually they're a bit overpriced as an Add-On item at Amazon, but the cookie itself...WOW!!!\n","neutral\n","This flavor is tasty.  It is a lot like the powder form from packets in taste, and convenient to use in the soda streams.  You should try it.\n","neutral\n","I love Tanka and being able to find it here at Amazon at such a great price just ROCKS!\n","neutral\n","Excellent and easy side dish.  Takes about 20 min to cook.  Excellent with any meat dishes or just a side salad making this the main course\n","neutral\n","I am sure it is super healthy, but the taste is a little rough. Will always mix with something to hide the taste.<br />Thanks for this great product, and very happy to see it comes from China and not Japan. Worried about the<br />radiation from Japanese tea.\n","neutral\n","I can not believe that people, especially diabetics, believe this fictitous hype about fructose being good for  one's blood sugar levels.  Fructose may not cause a rise in glucose levels like normal sugar does but it does negatively effect every thing else  in the body causing enormous harm to one's total well being.  If nothing else tells me that this company does not understand the intricacies of diet on diabetics this is the definitive proof that this company  does not know anything about nutrition.  Everyone should AVOID fructose and especially this company!!!!\n","neutral\n","I wanted to like this, I really did! I was so excited to get it after reading all the reviews on amazon. I was very impressed with what was in it, the price was so much cheaper than Vega brand (which I LOVE!) this was way too sweet! Ick! Why the need for three sweeteners!? Monk fruit, erythritol anddd stevia!? Have me a headache! :(\n","neutral\n","Very smooth tasting and I LOVE that it is DECAF so I can drink this in the afternoon & evening!\n","neutral\n","This is great! However, it's a little too chocolatey for me so I only use one scoop. Using a small whisk works best for mixing because it is a bit lumpy otherwise.\n","neutral\n","Really enjoying trying the new flavors in this pack.\n","neutral\n","Best Coconut water I've ever had.\n","neutral\n","Wife loves it\n","positive\n","It's hard to rate this - the popcorn is just okay tasting, but the smell of it popping is horrendous!!! Who wants to eat something that smells like vomit!!  Weaver really needs to work on this.\n","neutral\n","Very nice flavor\n","positive\n","Coffee on your schedule, or the way you like it, isn't  always available. These single serving bags are convenient, take up very little space in your purse or luggage, and they make a decent cup of coffee quickly.\n","neutral\n","These are the best dried mangoes I've ever had! They're absolutely my favorite.\n","neutral\n","Tasty snack\n","neutral\n","I always enjoyed Jell-O pudding! When I found out what simple ingredients were in it, I started making my own. Mostly it is just sugar and cornstarch, real cheap ingredients. You add milk either way.  This tastes great! If you don't want artificial colors, unneeded salt, artificial flavors, preservatives, and thickening agents make your own. If you want easy, buy this stuff.\n","neutral\n","Makes great lemon water\n","positive\n","I buy these for my father who has recently lost a lot of weight. With regular meals he managed to gain 6 lbs in a two week period. He feels better and is more inclined to eat.\n","neutral\n","Good thanks\n","positive\n","Great taste and consistency for pulling oil!\n","neutral\n","Less than a week and I had TONS of little plants in the Sproutamo. If you are going to separate them for planting, etc. you may want to use fewer seeds to begin with. I had a very condensed chunk of sprouts that were hard to separate because of being intermingled. Great for fresh salads.\n","neutral\n","Delicious! My toddler loves them!\n","positive\n","grossly overpriced. DO NOT BUY!\n","neutral\n","just didn't do it for me I guess taste buds change after years of not having any\n","neutral\n","It's pure clove oil.  Very strong.  Good for toothaches.\n","neutral\n","Best cookies ever!\n","positive\n","Was looking for a new coffee to try and just did a search for ground coffee and then organized the results in order of highest ratings by Amazon customers.  This one came near the top of the list.  So basically we ordered this cold with no prior experience.  We were not disappointed.  Definitely one of our favorite coffees if not THE favorite.  It is a little bold, but also smooth and not bitter.  Just like several other reviewers, we are not fans of Starbucks which tastes burnt most of the time.  Cafe Molido Santo Domingo is strong without all that bitterness. And we made this discovery just by accident!  Very pleased.\n","neutral\n","Very Sad!!!!.I was sent Mike and Ike not Jelly beans.Send me a credit??????......\n","neutral\n","Arrived in great time and is absolutely delicious!\n","positive\n","Arrived in an excellent time frame. will defintely shop again.\n","neutral\n","It is a very good product\n","neutral\n","The sauce has an ok flavor, but it is way too runny. It unfortunately ran off the chicken we were bbq-ing. In addition, it has high fructose corn syrup in it so won't be buying it again\n","neutral\n","This is my secret recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Hate to say this for fear that it will sell out before I get mine....but here goes.... Some of you know that you NEVER throw away the turkey carcass after Thanksgiving. You put it in a pot, add your special ingredients, and make soup! I discovered Vigo Collard Green Soup mix in my supermarket and used it to flavor up my turkey soup. IT WAS A HIT!!! That was approx 10 years ago. Now whenever we want turkey soup, I cut to the chase and buy some turkey legs, spice em up, roast em a bit, then drop them in a big pot with the Vigo Collard Green Soup mix till the meat drops off the bones (I remove all of the bones before serving). Now I can't find this soup in the supermarket, but thank goodness for Amazon!\n","neutral\n","Excellent!\n","positive\n","First time to try Militia coffee and I love the flavor.\n","neutral\n","tasty\n","neutral\n","yummy!\n","positive\n","This is the vanilla oreo cookies, but the center is a little different than what it normally is, the creamy center is like fruit punch, a little fruity and sweet. It is worth a try and is a good flavor.\n","neutral\n","This was such a great dealthat I purchased two. Very happy and would highly recommend. Thank you.\n","positive\n","this is great tea, seems to help with sugar cravings<br />arrived super fast\n","positive\n","Love these raw sugar cubes! They are so great with coffee and cream. Thank you Saint Louis I've never seen these except in a five star restaurant.<br />Merci beaucoup.\n","neutral\n","I ordered 2 more goats milk so I can receive my free sample..I  did not get one..\n","neutral\n","Surprised at how delish this is! Had it both hot and cold with almond milk and honey.\n","neutral\n","best tasting popcorn I have ever made.\n","neutral\n","Thank You. Just what I was looking for exactly !!!!\n","neutral\n","No 'snob appeal' here... just GOOD coffee... Try it before this type of bean (Arabica)  gets unaffordable....unless you prefer robusto.\n","neutral\n","Worked great to for my lemonade- I pour hot water over a tablespoon of honey and squeeze some fresh lemons in before stirring and pouring over ice. The flavor is spectacular, definitely better than the types that are manufactured to make for easy pouring/ squeezing out of a bottle. It is not extremely hard but you do have to scoop it out, which is why it is in a jar.\n","neutral\n","This is the best roasted peanut oil I could find and has become a staple in my kitchen after becoming a fan of Deborah Madison's Field of Greens cookbook. It is great with salads, noodle dishes, asian foods and much more. After several failed attempts to get our grocery stores to order this for me Amazon came through. Do not trust the company website for availability or their suggestion that the stores they list will be able to get it. That certainly has not been true for Albertson's in Colorado. They tried for months to no avail.\n","neutral\n","Whoever made this product does not know what real Horchata tastes like. A real waste of my money. And needless to say, a real disappointment since I purchased two.\n","neutral\n","I love the taste of these.  The mints are the best. But they sent these here, one box of each flavor, and they are BIG boxes.  I live in Texas. They were supposed to come fast, but not fast enough I think. They packed them with styrofoam and then put several ice packs on the inside. We were home when they arrived and took them right into the house. The temperature inside this box was higher than my house was. The obviously get very low marks on transporting something which melts. They firmed back up again but it left the outside layer of chocolate crumbly and messy.  If you don't mind that, they still taste good! The mints are the best. The peanut butter is the worst at crumbling and the coconut tastes too sweet to me, and I love sweets. You can get them to keep coming, one box/month. But be sure you look at the size of these boxes.  I didn't and they are huge!  Good if you like them. They say they are for a limited time so it will be interesting to see if they keep up the deliveries. You can skip a month or more and I did ask them to skip September because of both the volume of sweets and the temperature. We will see what happens in October!\n","neutral\n","Always order this.  It is a good price.\n","neutral\n","We bought these as a gift for my mother-in-law. I am allergic to one of the ingredients (soy) so I cannot taste for myself, but she loves the taste and strongly recommends the variety of hot cocoa. Recommended.\n","neutral\n","The 8 cans had been taken out of their plastic protective wrap and 5 dented cans were substituted and thrown in with the other 3 cans unwraped. Pretty shoddy in my way of thinking.\n","neutral\n","Great popcorn but when my package arrived it was smashed and half open. Better care with packaging would be my recommendation.\n","neutral\n","You will find it's flaked, NOT chunk. AYOR! Better to snag this, on sale, at your local supermarket.\n","neutral\n","good\n","positive\n","Arrived in a timely manner and is very good\n","neutral\n","This has a very anise sent and flaver.  I have grow tarragon at home and bought it elsewhere.

Not worth the price you're paying for the name.\n","neutral\n","Wish there were more per-bag, but very happy regardless.\n","positive\n","This Bean salad is delicious.  I eat it with almost everything, sandwiches, salads even hot meals I'll put a spoonful on the side.  You get 3 jars in this deal, and I can see they're not going to last long, but I don't mind.  They're so delicious I'll be ordering more.\n","neutral\n","This is a very high quality cacao powder that impresses with its rich and smooth taste, lack of bitterness despite the absence of added sugar, and consistent taste from the single origin beans sourced from family-owned farms in the Dominican Republic.  I have only used it in drinks so far, and a little bit goes a far way.  I'd be interested in making raw chocolate bars infused with local spices or some no-bake deserts.  The customer service is also outstanding and will answer in no time your questions about the product.\n","neutral\n","Great product. Needed if you want to prepare great tasting dishes.\n","positive\n","I got hooked on this delicious coffee while I was in Hawaii on a trip. I was thrilled to find that I could have it shipped to my home and have done so and it's always a special treat, for the last six years. Love it!\n","neutral\n","Love it. it's great. I always want more.\n","positive\n","They were great my daughter love them\n","positive\n","Great value.\n","positive\n","I mostly use a French press and reuse the beans for various things so the waste is very minimal however I wanted a quick and easy way to have a quick cup at my desk on some of my busy days. I was feeling really guilty thinking of all my k cups piling up in the land fill and although this is not perfect as some of the packaging is not biodegradable, I feel much better knowing that I'm reducing some of the waste! This is such a great tasting coffee as well, I will definitely be buying these frequently.\n","neutral\n","Just what my husband and mother wanted.

I am so hooked their website is on my Favorites list. I order on a regular basis. -  so addicted!!!\n","neutral\n","Great.\n","positive\n","These things should probably come with an addiction warning. Price is better than the local lux-market; will order again.\n","neutral\n","I own a small restaurant and offer a candle to top a dessert for b'day guests. these are perfect. colorful and I like the stars. cute.<br />like that I can buy the quantity I need. will reorder when needed.\n","neutral\n","Great tea.  High quality and great flavor.  The tea bags come in the very box shown in the stock picture.  It's a brown box with 100 tea bags in it.  That of course does not take away from the joy of this tea.  For me, it's the perfect green tea.\n","neutral\n","I was looking for a sweetner and flavor for my coffee. This is perfect! I got the hazelnut flavor and will be ordering more flavors next time! Excellent alternative to sugar and artificial sweetners.\n","neutral\n","Great.\n","positive\n","Tried to re live memory these were very hot, took my breathe away, but very good.\n","neutral\n","A friend and neighbor who recently moved from Washington State turned me on to this. Unfortunately, I could not find it in the stores around San Antonio. If you like flavor without the addition of MSG's, then this seasoning is for you!\n","neutral\n","Good tasting tomatoes, however you still need to remove the peels on some of the tomatoes. Also they only put in two small leaves of basil so really there is not much basil taste to it.\n","neutral\n","arrived on and intact with no leakage\n","neutral\n","Great\n","positive\n","Love, love, love this product. Real Salt is my brand for everything salt and has been for 30 years!\n","neutral\n","My little girl love them\n","neutral\n","Excellent\n","positive\n","Gave as gift to my mom. She never said if she liked it.\n","neutral\n","Beware! Use a spoon or something to retrieve salt from bag, unless you do not mind getting a little black on your fingers. This sea salt is not all that special that I have found. The black is only on the outside, if you crush it in a mortar and pestle you will see that the inside is still white. I do suggest you crush the sea salt up, as the pieces are rather large. It is still a good product and I like that its black, but the name makes you think the sea salt may have absorbed some spice to it while forming.\n","neutral\n","I have the spoonable and wanted something I could put in my purse for travel. I'm so done with unhealthy alternative sweeteners. This is great because it is extra sweet and you only need one packet when you would need two of another brand.\n","neutral\n","delicious\n","positive\n","This is my second bottle.  No comparision to grocery store pure vanilla, and it is a better value.\n","neutral\n","Why buy the every day salt when you can buy something not stripped of all its minerals??  Perfect product, will buy again!\n","neutral\n","Very excellent.  Wish I could get it locally and cheaper.  It's amazing on popcorn.\n","positive\n","Its really to bad that Kraft has stopped selling this and their other pasts salads at our local grocery stores.

This is my son's favorite tea to brew in our keurig every morning. I also love the pg black tea bags. We use those in our keurig as well.\n","neutral\n","Coffee is great. The pods are cloth on the bottom. So you have to store the coffee in plastic so the coffee doesn't get stale. One of the conveniences of cups is usually the ease of storage.\n","neutral\n","These are terrific, but they did dry out more quickly than I expected. Since I generally buy them retail, I thought perhaps that the case I bought might have been a bit old.\n","neutral\n","Great product to supplement smoothies, and tastes great.\n","positive\n","I really enjoy this brand of coconut water. Tastes great. An excellent drink first thing in the morning. I take it with my garcinia cambogia.\n","neutral\n","pops good, last long time\n","neutral\n","Taste great and seems to be all natural.

Zap it for a few seconds and you'll be taken back,to tour childhood days.\n","neutral\n","I was very disappointed in these flowers.First it came without a card and the message that I wrote. The person didn't know who they came from, until I inquired. I saw this also in some other reviews, but just thought it was a fluke.<br /><br />Secondly, the flowers did not bloom well. And they started wilting after the first day. Half of them were dead in three days.<br /><br />Lastly, the picture shows more of a red color roses. They ended up being light pink and not the color for the occasion.<br /><br />I would not recommend these flowers.\n","neutral\n","The person I got this for seemed disappointed with it's size. I checked the description to see if I could find the weight & dimensions, but there weren't any...\n","neutral\n","Not bad, but clearly not home made and not worth the cost. For jar pasta sauces there are 2 choices: Victorias and Rao's. I believe that Victoria makes both of them but they are excellent and worth every penny. Il Mulino should revisit their recipe to ensure their great reputation isn't tarnished.\n","neutral\n","I thought there would be more in the package for the money.<br />I do like the mix of flavors, and will continue buying them.\n","neutral\n","Love it, I have been making it almost every day.\n","neutral\n","My daughter and I are \\\\\"COFFEE SNOBS\\\\\" and relish good, full flavored strong coffee that is smooth on the tongue.

Disappointed.\n","neutral\n","If you have never baked with coconut flour, you need to try it.  This is a good price for the flour compared to many health food stores.  Although it is more expensive than regular flour, you use far smaller amounts because coconut flour absorbs liquids more readily.  It has a low gi and is gluten free and the taste is subtle and nice.\n","neutral\n","One of my favorite bean soups. Plenty of firm beans and vegetables and lower sodium. Great taste.\n","neutral\n","Favor fades quickly, but I am not sure if there is a natural way to prevent that with xylitol-based gum.

With no known negative side affects.\n","neutral\n","Good\n","positive\n","If I could give a higher rating, trust me I would! I'm a vegetarian so a veg friendly bacon flavored mayo is hard to find.

Smallish (approx 1.5 &#34; across) melt in you mouth shortbread type cookie with delicious lemon curd style filling.  Not a shy lemon flavor, but a definite, slightly tart filling.  If you love lemon flavor like I do these will be a pleasant surprise.  YUMMO!!\n","neutral\n","Excellent if you like wasabi. Much cheaper than buying the small bags in the store. Goes a long way.

Great Blend.\n","positive\n","On its own, not great. If you use this as a base and jazz it up a bit with some everyday kitchen ingredients, its quite tasty.

She just gobbles them by the bunches. Perfect for a stroll when she is ancy, just give her some and shes cool.

Unfortunately, they're incredibly gritty and unpleasant. There is a large quantity of dirt that ends up in each serving, which is incredibly gross.

I recommend choosing a brand that cleans their seeds more thoroughly.<br />----------------------------<br />Update: HealthWorks took the time to contact me and make the situation right. They sent me a new bag, free of charge. This one has been much less gritty. They were also nice enough to send me a bonus 1lb bag of raw cacao powder. Great customer service.

Is it a knock-off with very clever packaging? Is it seconds from whatever company manufactures Sure-Jell?

Because I previously had a gift basket business, I attend the huge annual Fancy Food Show every year.  At this year’s FFS a number of companies who are now selling on Amazon asked if I would review their product. I accepted some of those offers and let the company know that it would be an honest review.<br /><br />I’ve seen Almondina brand “cookies” at the show – and in stores – for many years. They are the original brand and, this year alone, I saw four other “copy cats”. Honestly, I had only been buying the “original flavor” – Almond – which is where the name of the company came from.  But one of the samples I received this month was this “combo” with both almonds and cherries in a chocolate cookie.  I thought I’d find artificial flavor and an overpowering cherry taste (sort of like Black Forrest Cake) and was surprised that the taste was even and these were real dried cherries.  They are all natural. Basically (in this order) Nuts, cherries,  flour, sugar.cocoa mass, cocoa powder and egg whites (plus “Natural flavor”) and they appear to be “shelf-stable” since my package in August 2014 had a “best used by” date of March 2015.<br /><br />The calorie content is 132 but you get 4 cookies for that and much of the calorie content (and fat 4.2 g for 4 cookies.) comes from the “healthy” – in moderation, of course –nuts. Each 4 oz package holds 16 cookies (I prefer to call them wafers).  They are really nice to add a bit of a “treat” to your mid-morning or after dinner coffee (when I have always used them).<br /><br />Unlike the pistachio variety I tried a few weeks ago – which crumbled easily – these cookies seem firmer and – though they were shipped, none of the 16 cookies was broken. They are thin and you should treat the packages also as gently as a bag of potato chips.<br /><br />If you like the other flavors I can certainly recommend this variety. Just make sure you like cherries.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”f potato chips.<br /><br />If you like the other flavors I can certainly recommend this variety.

The juices were the most vile, disgusting, undrinkable concoctions I have ever tasted. This was my first experience juicing, and I certainly didn't expect to enjoy it or love the product, but I also didn't expect to physically be unable to swallow the juices either. I like all vegetables, but the celery taste and smell are overwhelming and the combination of flavors are disgusting. The drinks also seemed to get progressively grosser (I managed to drink about 95% of the first drink, 70% of the second, 30% of the third, and then I quit after that). Only the vanilla cloud is even remotely drinkable, but by the time I got to that I was so nauseous at the thought of swallowing another sip that I poured it down the drain. What a waste of money. I really think that anyone who says that they love these juices has to be lying, to themselves and the world!!

And then the tahini in a jar I opened tasted stale, a disheartening experience--so the remaining jars are still sitting on the shelf.

They were far and away the closest yet to providing a cup of coffee that is pretty close to what I used to make with my old grind and brew coffee maker.<br /><br />Either one of these blends that I mentioned produces a tasty cup of coffee. I bought this particular offer because the price for a 96 pack of this Black Tiger was too good to turn down. I will be adding some Jet Fuel for variety when I see an offer I can't refuse.

The product is passable as an instant brown rice.  Not much flavor, but it's passable if you need a quick side-dish or some filler ingredients for things likes soups.  But nothing to write home about.    However, I would like to address the huge issue- this is DANGEROUS to cook in the microwave!  The box (and website) proclaims that the cooking time in a microwave is seven minutes for 2 servings.  The instructions tell you to put the water and rice into a microwave-safe bowl and set the timer.    I did this once a few months ago, and at the five-minute mark I took the rice out and noticed that the water had completely evaporated and the rice was bizarre and overly crispy in terms of texture, and had even started to burn around the edges.  I decided to mark it up to me maybe not putting in enough water, and simply made some on the stove.    I tried it for a second time yesterday while visiting a friend, and this time it ended up almost setting his microwave on fire!  Three minutes in, I peeked in and noticed that the water seemed to be completely gone.  Weary but wanting to follow the instructions, I decided to let it cook another minute before checking it again.  When I returned about 60 seconds later, I found the microwave FULL of thick, billowing smoke.  Panicked, I opened the door and looked to see what was happening.  The rice had began to turn a dark, dark, burnt brown color (even become smoldering and black in spots) and was starting to burn up!  I can only imagine what would have happened if I let it go the full seven minutes!    Neither microwave is dysfunctional, and both are fairly weak microwaves.  (Usually we need to put things in a little longer, if anything.)  I have never, ever had this happen before with a product.  (I've cooked other rices in microwaves before when in a bind, although I prefer stove-top, and this never happens.)  And the fact it happened with two different microwaves (including one nice, big and expensive one and a smaller generic one) is just insane.    This is ludicrous.  Do they want us to set our houses on fire?\n","neutral\n","I asked my husband for his review and his response was 'mmmmmmm'.

Yet we have found that there are few coffees that DO appeal to both of us, (For reference purposes, one of them is [[ASIN:B005HUVI0E Newman's Own Special Blend Coffee]].) Though Newman's is billed as a \\\\\"medium roast, extra bold coffee,\\\\\" it is somehow never too strong for my wife's taste.<br /><br />San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser does not taste bitter, acidic or harsh, nor is it too \\\\\"blended\\\\\" or mild. It's just a nice, strong-medium tasting coffee that does a great job of 1) waking you up, and 2) tasting great.<br /><br />I also like their environmentally-friendly packaging. The ONLY small thing I'l like to see improved upon is a slight slimming of the upper ring extending downward about 1/2 inch from their top cover....that would allow the cups to fit inside the carousels.

It is filled with all sorts of flavors that compliment each other so you get a nice rounded out taste with each bite.<br /><br />The cooking time does not make it &#34;sudden.&#34; It takes about 20 minutes total, but I usually cook this long anyway. Plus, if I am making an actual salad, I'll spend about 10 minutes doing so. It is relatively small (will not feed a family of four) so I've used it as a lunch during the day at the office. I made it at home and brought it to the office. The only issue with that is that is does get a little...gummy.

Maybe these options will help.\n","neutral\n","With a name like Smucker's, er... White Lily, it has to be good.\n","neutral\n","One word desccription - disgusting.  I am soy, gluten, egg, some nuts intolerant.  I have tried several bars, some good and some not so goo.  Ordering these was a huge mistake..  To me the texture and taste is stomach turning.

Giant thumbs down.\n","neutral\n","Love this!!!\n","positive\n","tastes great\n","positive\n","Sweet!\n","positive\n","Good tasting for a no calorie dressing. Fantastic?

Perfect late night, or car ride snack!\n","positive\n","of course it tastes sweet, but I guess in country where everything else is sweeter, this one is fine. I make overnight oats(mix unsweetened yogurt/milk/granola together, put them in the fridge and next morning, voila, breakfast!) almost everyday and they tasted countless kinds of granola. This is obviously not the best kind - less chewy (I'd prefer rawer oats) but considering the price, I wouldn't complain too much. Just somebody please please tell me is there such a thing as unsweetened oats/granola in this country???\n","neutral\n","Beats canned broccoli soup any day! I love how quick and easy it is to make and tastes very good. Highly recommend this for anyone who likes Broccoli Soup.\n","neutral\n","These crackers are addicting.\n","neutral\n","I liked these but I had a hard time making a smooth batch.  Start mixing as soon as you add the liquid.  Flavor was good.  I still added some spices and I made them with milk instead of water.  The one large box that I got expired very soon but Amazon gave me credit for it.  I was not able to get a replacement because they were out of stock.  I ended up sharing the box with friends to consume within the expiration date.\n","neutral\n","Delicious and neat product!\n","positive\n","I like the cracker, my complaint is with the wrapper, its impossible to rewrap the package tight enough so the rest wont go bad before they can be used.\n","neutral\n","Love the flavor , but the conditions of the delivery was really poor\n","neutral\n","Same product is half the price in whole foods market which is considered to be an expensive place.\n","neutral\n","Always in my kitchen\n","neutral\n","The Raw Revolution bars are great. I appreciate the fact that I recognize all of the ingredients, and their taste is pleasant (not too sweet).  Calories are reasonable, sodium is low, fiber is high.  Sugar is high so you don't want to eat too many if you are otherwise consuming adequate calories and not climbing a mountain.  Double win on nutrition and taste.<br /><br />While Kind Plus Blueberry Pecan is my favorite nutrition bar, I enjoy any of them more with variety and these will be a repeat order.  I particularly enjoyed eating the Spirulina Dream, not because it takes so good (tastes like dates), but because it looks like a mass of seaweed and freaks out co-workers.<br /><br />Chocolate Raspberry Truffle - nice chocolate taste<br />Apple Cinnamon - mild apple-cinnamon flavor, lots of texture<br />Chocolate Crave and Heavenly Hazelnut Chocolate - tastes like a not-too-sweet brownie<br />Heavenly Hazelnut Chocolate - tastes like a not-too-sweet nut brownie (more crunch than nut taste)<br />Almond Butter Cup - rich buttery flavor, not much almond taste<br />Chocolate Coconut Bliss - like a Mounds brownie - really good<br />Golden Cashew - tastes just like every other cashew health bar I've eaten - not bad, just similar<br /><br />Spirulina Dream<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic Cashews, Organic Dates, Organic Sunflower Seed Kernels, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds, Organic Spirulina Powder, Organic Sprouted Flax Seed.<br />CONTAINS TREE NUTS.

The wraps are soft and thin, wrap nicely around food, and taste good enough without adding much flavor (they don't taste coconutty unless you eat them by themselves).<br /><br />I only wish they came in a larger size, too, as the wrap it creates is quite small.<br /><br />The last two times I ordered it, though, the wraps felt harder and didn't bend as nicely or have as smooth a texture.

As a pre-diabetic, I have to avoid sugar. Even a 16.9 ounce bottle of Coca-Cola at 55g of sugar (from Honest Tea's parent company), will raise my blood sugar enough to leave me feeling very tired.  Processed foods in general, contain too much sugar and salt. Thankfully, this brand of tea only contains 10mg of salt per bottle.<br />It does contain some unknown  \\\\\"natural flavor to balance acidity\\\\\", just enough to smooth out the black tea. I understand why they added \\\\\"natural flavor\\\\\", as the black tea can be pretty strong by itself.  I just wish that they would be honest about it and tell us what this \\\\\"natural flavor\\\\\" is.  Anyway, the tea tastes very good. If it spelled out all the ingredients, and it did not come in a breakable glass bottle, I would give it a rating of 5 stars, but as is in the glass bottle, I can only give it four stars.<br /><br />According to the label on the bottle:<br /><br />\\\\\"Label readers (you know who you are) have noticed that other manufacturers disguise the taste of their tea with all kinds of additives.

I needed a snack that wasn't going to be too heavy on my stomach. I didn't want caffeine either. I spotted this in my local mini-mart and decided to give it a whirl. It is applesauce-ish, but it was so easy to slurp down and go! It tasted a lot better than most of the energy products I've tried, too. Most of all, I didn't feel like I had a brick in my stomach like when I eat a banana prior to working out.

It took me no time to get used to it and now I don't miss chocolate at all. You can use this for smoothies, to bake with as a substitute for cocoa powder, for &#34;hot chocolate&#34; and to make carob chips or syrup. It is very versatile!\n","neutral\n","We have had Tang available in my home for many years, and for a few reasons. It's a tasty, delicious and refreshing drink. I like the powder, because I can make it fresh each time. As we go through the summer months here in AZ with brutal, intense heat, this is one of those refreshing beverages that we crave. We love the orange flavor, add Splenda instead of sugar, small bits of sliced oranges, and ice. The drink always quenches our thirst, and we don't get thirsty after drinking it, as we do with soda.<br /><br />Another reason why I like it is also because it is fortified with Vitamin C, and Calcium. As a special treat, sometimes we add some vanilla ice cream to a glass of Tang, and it tastes like the old orange-vanilla ice-pops that were once popular in the grocery stores, or sold from ice cream trucks like Good Humor.<br /><br />In comparison to Orange Juice, we find OJ very acidic, and my daughter doesn't like the pulp in OJ. However, Tang is not acidic, just simply refreshing. In addition, the price of OJ keeps climbing, and has become expensive. We prefer Tang, love the taste, and the price for a pack of 2 is Good. Highly recommended.\n","neutral\n","This is like the &#34;Bomb&#34; Organic Sesame Tahini.  I used it all up and ran out and mistakenly bought the once again brand and boy was it a mistake.

I have been making sprouts weekly using these seeds for over a year. I simply use a jar with a screened lid to grow my sprouts -- they take 4-5 days (or so) depending on air temperature, including an overnight soak first. I wash 1-2x a day with cold water, agitating the sprouts lightly to rinse. Once the sprouts are long enough, I store them in a non-airtight container (with either a paper towel or some drainage in the bottom) in the fridge and they will last a number of days.\n","neutral\n","I love this oil, it has been so perfect for my diet!!!

As snack cakes go these set the bar high. If you like cherry flavor (&#34;cherry-esque&#34; not cherry pie) give these a try. For ultimate flavor heat them in a microwave for 15 seconds to allow the almond flavored fondant layer to get a bit gooey.

I am not a huge coffee drinker just because of the cost, so I usually just go for the cheap powdered garbage that just gets the job done in terms of caffeine.  This stuff is so much better though.

I was so happy when I ordered it and I couldn't wait till it got here! It came today while I was at school and it came a few weeks early so that was a nice surprise. The nice thing about Popin Cookin is that the instructions are pretty easy to understand even if you don't Speak jappenesse! (There are plenty of videos explaining these things, I recommend emmymadeinjapan) anyways i have a appreciation for oddly textured food, but not all people are like that. If you don't like that kind of stuff I recommend you don't buy this! The flavors are really tasty to me! And this was also very fun to make, my mom even helped (she refused to eat them though)! The texture is nothing like the gummys you would find in the states. But overall I enjoyed this a lot! I would recommend this for sure!\n","neutral\n","sooo good!<br />A real hit. I love that they are individually packed and you can take just one. And it is gluten free which is a real plus for my granddaughter.\n","neutral\n","They arrived on time with two reuseable ice paks. The only thing is that the bags are really small. I guess that's  why they are sold in bulk. But for the price, i don't know if you want to buy these. You could buy 2 huge bags at your neiborhood store for half this price. All and all, these are very good truffles.\n","neutral\n","Enjoy the convenience of these.  Can have ice tea whenever I want it.\n","neutral\n","Great flavor and easy to transport makes this a refreshing drink to carry with you.\n","neutral\n","We have tried several Tonic Syrup brands. This one is the best tasting.\n","neutral\n","I originally tried this Ketch when I found it in a local store on close-out sale.  They were discontinuing it and I bought two bottles for a buck apiece.  I liked it so much I went back for more and they were gone for good.  So I looked on Amazon.<br /><br />I bought six bottles of this Ketchup and am now down to the last two.  The taste is superior to brands such as Heinz, etc.  The best part is that it only contains 7 grams of sugar per serving.  Salt content is a little high but I am more concerned about processed carbs such as sugar than too much sodium.  All-in-all a very tasty product for the money.\n","neutral\n","Very yummy!  And good for me?  I hope :-)\n","positive\n","Great product fast shipping thank you\n","positive\n","Always good\n","positive\n","Beware this is only (1) 4 oz box for $8.99 per box. Not (4) boxes as others are sold in a 4 box set\n","neutral\n","It's very nice and reminds me of Callard & Bowsers toffee.\n","neutral\n","My wife and I are big fans of Ito En, their bottled tea's are excellent and rich with flavor, these tea bags are up to the same flavor and are excellent.  I really like the nylon tea bags, seep time is recommend at 30 secs, and compared to traditional tea bags these are much faster.  True tea connoisseurs do not use tea bags, I know,  but for a quick cup of green tea at the office or in the morning without breaking out the infuser, these are perfect.<br /><br />Now on to the Matcha, I was not expecting much if any, and I was right.  There is a very small percentage of Matcha in the envelope, let's just say that the tea bag is dusted lightly with Match during packaging, the directions instruct that you dump out the dust into your cup after removing the tea bag, which equates to a very small amount floating in your cup.  It does add a nice touch, but don't expect traditional Matcha results.\n","neutral\n","Yum!  We'll be eating plenty of risotto.  This is my 3rd or 4th order of this rice over the years, it's a bargain compared to buying smaller size packages.  It works wonderful for risotto, being Italian, that is why I buy it.<br /><br />Checked for black bug like one reviewer said he had...none here...just clean rice.  Bagged it into Zip-lock Freezer bags and froze so it will stay fresh and bug-free.  Made a big pan of Risotto with an onion and veggie broth, a little butter and that was all; delicious.  Creamy and al dente.  Will buy again, and again.\n","neutral\n","Will never buy this product here. Quality is as usual. But quantity is misleading: 12 count or containers - means: 12 cups, - 3 packs with 4 cups in each of them. So, you pay more than $5 for 4 cups. Never saw this pack more than $3 dollars in any local store.\n","neutral\n","These taste really good if you like pecans. Unfortunately, they are over-priced on Amazon.\n","neutral\n","love the product must have received older product not as good as the first batch ordered enjoy them though will definitly pay more attention when ordering nect time\n","neutral\n","This hot sauce is the talk of the town, so I figured I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Typically, I use Franks Original, but I decided to give this a try and it definitely was a good decision.<br /><br />Using Franks as a benchmark, this sauce is quite a bit sweeter with very little of the vinegary aftertaste you'd get with Franks as there seems to be much less of a vinegar ratio. Throughout the entire bite, the spice is balanced with sugar and you get a great garlic taste which accents it perfectly to complete the sauce. The spice is fair, but it is in no way overwhelming and the taste of the food always prevails. I personally would rate Tabasco sauce way above this in regards to spice, if that's any help.<br /><br />The only downside of this is, in my case, these were shipped loosely in a plastic bag as part of a Subscribe and Save delivery. Needless to say, a big box with other items in it did not fare well as these were moving about and their tips acted like knives puncturing the insulation air bag packing causing everything to tumble around freely damaging products in transit.

These cough drops meet and exceed my expectations.  I have a chronic cough that no doctor seems to be able to solve and I use a lot of cough drops.  Not only are these sugar free but the variety of mint flavors is more like using a candy mint than a cough drop.  No nasty after taste.  No dry mouth.  Spearmint, Menthol and another mint which make these a pleasure to take ongoing.  Thank you Halls!  I have tried all your other flavors and everyone else's too.

And after all that, it had to taste decent to a taste-savvy 30 yr. old, working preggo. So this ended up being the clear choice.

There is little perceptible taste or texture difference between the two.  Za'atar spice mixes however, can vary widely because of ingredient variations and country of origin.\n","neutral\n","Third order. I like and use these everyday.

It is like coffee pre-laced with lots of creamer and sweeteners and as such it comes out tan, not brown... in that respect it is more of a dessert coffee drink than it is a &#34;coffee for coffee drinkers&#34;, but that's exactly what I wanted.\n","neutral\n","These were great olives as they are gone!\n","neutral\n","This stuff tastes pretty good, but it doesn't seem like it will last very long.<br /><br />I like it better than Pacific Chai's Vanilla Chai Latte or Trader Joe's instant chai, though I'd probably rank it about the same as Pacific Chai's Spice Chai Latte.\n","neutral\n","I have to say, this is awesome coffee.

Gone are the deep, complex fruit flavors, replaced by overly-sweet and cheap tasting candies.  This will be my last order.<br /><br />What's more annoying than the &#34;new recipe?&#34;  The fact that they didn't advertise / communicate the change to buyers!  Bad marketing...\n","neutral\n","Love these! How wonderful not to use disposable cups that are such a waste!!!\n","neutral\n","No sliver shine, not to buy from this seller again.  Horrible just like the gold edible starts listed by the seller.  No shine and it is not for anything really, other than what I consider a little rip off. I am upset about this item.  I guess there is a first time for everything, including being had!!! Less than 1 star is the correct rating!\n","neutral\n","A more apt label would read, &#34;Planters Almond Lovers Mix.&#34;  I'm going to have to buy a second package so I can quantify the ratio of &#34;Jumbo&#34; cashews to almonds.  There are so few pecans that they barely deserve a mention.  Each of the three types of nuts were found to be excellent.  The ratio is extraordinarily misleading.  I'll provide an update once I weigh the contents next time.\n","neutral\n","We LOVE this coffee and the monthly auto delivery is awesome too!!!\n","neutral\n","Best pasta I ever had.

I'm a coffee-holic but don't like real strong coffee.  This is robust but not bitter.  I buy both the regular and D-caf and like them both.\n","neutral\n","These taste great and fresh.  Most nuts were whole on arrival, but a few were in pieces.  Not an issue, as I plan to grind into recipes like cashew cream, etc. - if we can stop eating them directly out of the bag. Yum!\n","neutral\n","i found my place to buy from now on. I did a science project with my second grader and it was a big success. I only make Iced lemon water and everyone takes a berry and coat their tongue. When you drink the lemon its like icy great lemonade. the yogurt and sour cream was a vanilla dessert. The granny smith apples were sweet and the strawberries were too sweet. The balsamic/apple cider vinegar was sweet and went down smooth with no burn. Wow! amazing.

I purchased from Amazon because the company only sell in quantities of 6 or more. Sooooo glad I didn't get six of these! If you are finicky, or sensitive to taste and smell, this might not be the product for you. I intended to call the company to see if I can add it to cooked foods instead of beverages in hopes of at least using it up in strongly flavored dishes.\n","neutral\n","this is a good buy and its good quality\n","neutral\n","Thank you.\n","positive\n","I'm very happy with this product.

Instead, I got a package of breath saver rolls.<br />If I had wanted rolls, I would have ordered them\n","neutral\n","Taste is great!\n","positive\n","I really like these and will buy more. They're nutty tasting but soft and chewy. I like them more than I thought I would,\n","neutral\n","Yes, this tea really works.  Has a great, soothing taste, but most of all has been amazing at calming my stomach down for the past week.  I have been suddenly suffering from a very sour stomach.  Every time I eat\\, my stomach becomes very painful and I would become very nauseous.  Zegerid, Zantac, and Tums were helping a little, but not enough.  Then I saw this tea and decided to try it.  I drink it during a meal and after.  There is no doubt in my mind that this tea is helping to ease the pain and discomfort which previously had me curling up into a ball on the couch.  After all, I'm writing this rather than suffering on the couch, and I credit this tea for the help.  Is it a cure? Doubtful, of course.  But if it can get me through the discomfort immediately following a meal until thing settle down, I'll take it!\n","neutral\n","This smoothie is simply delicious.

Mine came less red and more pink in color, I'd chosen this brand for that extra red color and was a bit surprised.  Keep in mind this is my first purchase of Himalayan salt so maybe I'm wrong, but I can say that my crystals do not look as dark as what appeared on my monitor and it was a big factor in me going with this company.<br /><br />I'll change my review if I find out I'm wrong in the future and this is typical, but again I did get lighter color crystals than my computer monitor showed.

Hubby has been drinking a more inexpensive good coffee, but he has been drinking this one on weekends. Last week, I noticed Peet's disappearing quickly, could be me, then he told me not to buy the previous brand. He really likes the bold, smooth taste of Peet's. I'm considering Peet's House Blend, just to save a few bucks.  We'll see.\n","neutral\n","Good Earth tea is the best I have ever had.  It's excellent hot or iced.

Even though this is a medium roast, I was persuaded by all the rave reviews and hype surrounding Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  It may be smooth, but that is because it is virtually tasteless.  It is like drinking coffee WATER.  No taste and ridiculously over priced... I am astounded by the high reviews.  Back to purchasing only Bold or Extra Bold roasted coffee.  Expresso, French and Italian roasts are the best for those who don't want to just taste the creamer.\n","neutral\n","Product arrived just as I expected.\n","neutral\n","smells good, tastes salty.  pricey for salt, but not as pricey as some other gourmet salts.  pretty smokey, so you need to like that.....\n","neutral\n","Absolutely delicious.

It's also acidic, but has no depth at all, more like coffee water. I tried sumatra flavor and it was better. I will buy other flavors, before giving up on this company. This flavor is not for me, i like rich bitter, delicious coffee.\n","neutral\n","I don't drink tap water, so this was really a necessity. Shipping was fast.\n","neutral\n","Very good product\n","positive\n","I was a tad bit disappointed in their newer version of their coconut almond chocolate spread. When I had my first bite on an olive loaf, something tasted off. And it wasn't the combination of olives and this chocolate spread. I felt that something was missing--dessicated coconut! & this was one thing I really enjoyed in the old spread because it was unique, but nonetheless it's a really great spread, but I probably won't order for myself unless the old one is still available!\n","neutral\n","We preferred the flavor of Tomr's to Kina.\n","neutral\n","I love that this water is a healthy alternative to soda/pop and that it is GLUTEN FREE, as something like this should be anyway. The flavor is subtle enough and though it doesn't leave you with a WOW impression, it is so much better than most artificially flavored drinks. It is the perfect serving size.  I also like that the packaging is light weight so you can travel with it.  I order it through 'Subscribe and Save' program and I am able to save 15% off my order with 5 or more items ordered together.\n","neutral\n","Ex-Wife did not think it was appropriate to give my 4 year old this.

I think there was a Louis ck joke about this company, which I heard after purchasing.  I use a fair amount of aluminum foil and thought I would try this brand.  It worked fine for a few times and then I noticed my sheets had gotten smaller.  The foil had ripped a small amount at one end and become smaller with each use.  By the time I realized it, it was too far gone.  I tried everything but was left with at least half a roll of unusable expensive foil.

But after some thought, the price of this is definitely in the packaging, not the contents because after all you have to add the most expensive part, the booze!  The bag comes with a powder mix inside, you add water and the booze, shake and freeze.  I'm calling on the manufacturer to offer the powder mix as a refill for the empy bag.  Not only can we save thousands of these plastic bottles (bags) from going into landfills, but they can greatly reduce the cost and make this an even better consumer product!\n","neutral\n","Excellent flavor enhancer\n","positive\n","Great coffee system...over priced through Amazon.

Do not use it with any other strong herbs or spices and the Merlot should come through. Its still a good sea salt and I think the novelty of it is kind of cool.\n","neutral\n","Yum.  Great almond flavor.  I found this one a little stronger than the other Amoretti flavors - didn't need as many pumps for my coffee drink to get that flavor.  But that only means I get even more bang for my buck!

Yacon syrup not only has lots of both, but also contains 50% FOS (fructooligosacharides), which is said to help boost metabolism. Yacon syrup is a powerful antioxidant, and this is organic certified. I love adding this to smoothies as a sweetener!\n","neutral\n","I absolutely am in love with these teas. My mother and I always enjoy a glass before bed, as only one of them has caffeine.

There's one downside to this though... you need some insane self control to restrict yourself from eating more than 3 of these at a time as they are ridiculously addictive!<br /><br />The shipping method Amazon used (expedited chilled) was done perfectly with multiple cooling packs and liberal thermal insulation wrapping the box these are in. Shipped in temperatures in excess of 100°F, not a single candy shows the slightest signs of deformation or melting and arrived in pristine condition.\n","neutral\n","I had never sprouted seeds before and I spent a lot of time on reviews and information. Let me save you a lot of time and effort. Just buy this one! This is my first review ever, on anything. I live in a humid hot area and have limited counter space, so the mason jar method was going to take up too much space. These are much bigger than I expected, yet don't take up a lot of room.     I did watch the instruction videos on YouTube since I wanted to make sure I did everything correctly and I've been eating sprouts every day since then. I now have 3 of these since I eat a lot of sprouts for a snack (and even breakfast) with lemon juice and pink sea salt.  Even the kids at work love these and steal them from my plate. The college bound kids all want to buy one of these for their dorm.    I leave the small snap in converter for small seeds snapped in all the time. It doesn't hurt anything and that way I never worry about the size of my seeds. Learned that the hard way! Ha!    Now that I'm obsessed with sprouting I want to try the Handy Pantry 3 tier tray just to see if it works as well, but I'll always keep these in rotation.\n","neutral\n","The only way I know how to describe this malt vinegar is to compare it to other malt vinegars.<br /><br />This is not like the Captain D's nor Heinz malt vinegar. It is much weaker with less of a vinegar and malt taste. This is very subtle. If you are expecting a malt vinegar with a strong taste/bite, you will be disappointed. BOTH the vinegar and malt are weaker tasting.<br /><br />This is more like London Pub malt vinegar.<br /><br />For fish, I prefer to dilute the Heinz with Sarsons or London Pub.<br /><br />For salads, fries, tomatoes, and cucumbers I like Sarsons/London Pub with olive oil and a lot of black pepper. Sometimes I add a bit of white vinegar.\n","neutral\n","Nice green tea.\n","positive\n","good but high price\n","neutral\n","This is one of my favorites....I love the nuts and the cranberries that are added to this granola and it is GF!\n","neutral\n","Great coffee\n","positive\n","I fell in love with this coffee when I got married in Antigua almost 10 years ago.

Some are sold here on Amazon, others are only in the store. And so I liked the idea of chocolate and coconut. How can you go wrong with that?<br />It doesn't taste anything like chocolate or coconut, but it does have a chemical odor and taste. I threw out the box, and this is the first time I have had to throw out a box of tea in years.<br /><br />It appears that the plastic taste is coming from the tea bags. They are plastic. They are described as 'silken', but it is actually a plastic.<br /><br />Google: 'Are tea bags turning us into plastic', to see why this is a bad idea.\n","neutral\n","Very GOOD EVOO and made in California, U.S.A.!! It's great for cooking and tastes good. A bit pricey but worth it.\n","neutral\n","If the reviews of the bad taste aren't enough to discourage you from buying this bread, perhaps the fact the FDA says that you aren't getting what is claimed on the label might convince you.

It took a couple of tries to place the flavor and I finally nailed it- it tastes like tobacco. Specifically, the sweetish smell of unburnt pipe tobacco or the inside of a cigar humidor. Its not bad but certianly not what I was looking for, and nothing at all like rooibos.\n","neutral\n","One of my daughters favorites\n","neutral\n","I was very disappointed with the taste, feel, and smell of this product. The cinnamon tasted bland, like too much filler was added. It felt like I was eating dirt. And, the aroma was light, washed out.

I don't have a lot of options for Asian markets here.

Also the used by date is only like 2 months.  Not very long if you order 192 creamers, also with about 20% bad due to leaks.  I hope i can get refund, its not worth the effort to return it back for $10.  Overall pretty good creamer, but buying bulk supply with short shelf life and good portion of creamers leaked its not worth purchasing in my opinion.  Hope others have better luck.\n","neutral\n","This is definitely the best granola I've ever had, much better than any big-name granola. It has a strong flavor and isn't soft, unlike many other granolas. When I have the granola with milk the spices color the milk. That doesn't happen with any other granola, and I've tried a lot of them.<br /><br />The other nice thing about this granola is that it's so healthy, with olive oil, almonds, and pecans. A lot of health foods don't taste very good, but not this one. In fact, people might eat too much of it because it tastes so darn good.\n","neutral\n","This was a gift for a friend that was traveling to her small home town.\n","neutral\n","SUPER FAST SHIPPING AND GREAT SERVICE. VERY TASTY PRODUCT.  I RECOMMEND INSPIRED PERU!\n","positive\n","I love this stuff...coffee taste + makes you sleep<br />Highly recommend if you love both\n","positive\n","A simple portable way to have SpaghettiO's. You will need to puncture the film to microwave it, and then when it is piping hot after sitting in the microwave the extra minute, you are supposed to peel back the top. The top is pretty challenging to peel off without burning yourself, or spilling sauce everywhere. I do not recommend this for children to be cooking with.<br /><br />So on one hand it is nice that it comes in its own bowl ready to microwave, but on the other hand it isn't practical for use with kids.\n","neutral\n","Melted and smashed, arrived in a plain yellow unprotected envelope.

Due to health reasons I have to avoid almost all grains and that was getting to be unreasonably expensive.

I bought these with high hopes for a good hotdog experience. Disappointing.<br />They would make a good sub or grinder roll but are MUCH too substantial to be used as a hot dog vehicle. Tasty? yes. Soft? no.<br />My criteria for a hot dog roll is it should not resemble an artisan baked bread product or roll by any stretch of the imagination.<br />It should be mostly air held in a roll shaped configuration by minimum amounts of grain flour and add little if any character to the hot dog eating experience.<br /> Double fail and subtract 3 stars for mislabeling.\n","neutral\n","The first product had a little caffeine in it and I thought it worked great but this new version has taken that out so I stopped buying because it no longer worked for me.\n","neutral\n","Arrived promptly.

I almost passed out on my bed 1 hour after drinking a cup with coconut oil.  The crash was almost as though I were tripping on salvia, but without the hallucinations.<br /><br />I think I'll just stick to Peet's ground coffee from now on since I like the taste of it better anyway.<br /><br />I'm starting to think that the caffeine content isn't what caused the crash.  I think it's related to some sort of chemical that's in the instant coffee as the article mentioned.<br /><br />It's funny that I'm more prone to crashing on coffee beverages than I am on sugar free energy drinks.  Makes me just want to go back to energy drinks like Sparkling Rock Star.\n","neutral\n","If you're a Starbuck's coffee fan, this is for you!

This item tastes awesome and is great for you but beware the pricing.\n","neutral\n","I have a thorough-going zombie apocalypse survival kit in my car at all times. One important item that most people forget - but I learned the hard way in the Army how important it is - good hot sauce. And this is the perfect solution! See, in the hard world of post Day-Z, getting your hands on fresh, delicious food could be pretty hard. But a dash of zombie cajun hot sauce, and you'll be in much better shape.<br /><br />The sauces in this variety are all excellent. My family's particular favorite is the garlic hot sauce, which has a deep, many-layered garlic flavor with just the right amount of heat to give your tongue a jostle, but not completely kick it in. The hottest of the bunch, the extra-hot habanero flavor is just (in my opinion) the right amount of &#34;a little too hot.&#34; Because sometimes, you want to suffer a little - to make that burn hurt...but not without a good, complex flavor. Honestly, I think habeneros are the pepper with the best flavor, they're just so hot you can only take a bit of them, unless you're one of those people that scoffs at big pepper heat. You want your bloody mary to be kickin', but still delicious? This is the extra hot sauce for you.<br /><br />The standard model zombie cajun sauce is good stuff. It's maybe about as hot as a traditional tabasco, but with nuanced, savory flavor that is superb with say..jambalaya, or hash browns, or anything a little starchy. The burn is there, but it fades fast, leaving you ready for more. The langiappe pepper hot sauce is cajun-licious. Turn your gumbo into gumb-Ohh-my! It's a unique flavor with a delicious bite.<br /><br />Look, we're all worried about the zombie apocalypse. But no need to fear a lack of flavor in the inevitable end of human civilization. Zombie Cajun Hot Sauce is so delicious, even the zeds will give up brains for it!\n","neutral\n","tastes great, very great for snacking\n","positive\n","Love this product.  I have used it several times and it flavors just like the &#34;bacon grease your mom used to have&#34;.  Almost 1 of the 3 containers is almost gone already.

Here  it breaks down to $2.98 a can and if you qualify for the free shipping...well, folks that ain't bad , in particular if you eat a lot of this stuff like we do and if you live in a state that does not tax you for purchases on-line.<br />But on to the actual product and not the price......<br /><br />Now there is no way that I will state that canned asparagus is better than fresh.  We lived in Idaho for a number of years and picked tons of wild asparagus when in season and ate it two meals a day for the duration...we love the stuff.  That being said though, we simply do not have to option of fresh asparagus all of the time in our local stories and half the time it is available it is of such low quality and high price that we simply will not buy it.<br /><br />Both my wife and I grew up eating canned asparagus, Green Giant, to be specific, and we most certainly have developed a taste for it.  In many ways (please to not make fun of me) I like it better than fresh or frozen.  I know that is almost sacrilegious but I can't help myself.  I like it best heated with melted butter and just a bit of salt and pepper; although a nice melted cheese sauce is nice also.  My wife uses this stuff in various dishes she prepares and it most certainly goes into her vegetable soup she makes each winter.  I love it in a cheese soup she prepares also.<br /><br />We have, in the past, tried other brands but we always return to the Green Giant.  I suppose that is because that is what we were brought up on but we have found the consistency of the quality to be better with Green Giant than other brands and also the texture and flavor.<br /><br />I note that some other reviewers have noted that when they receive their orders they receive damaged cans.  I hope this does not happen to me when I order as it is a pet peeve of mine...more of an obsessive neurosis I suppose, because I won't even purchase canned goods at the store it there is even a scratch in the label. I am going to take a chance...  We shall see.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkshope this does not happen to me when I order as it is a pet peeve of mine...more of an obsessive neurosis I suppose, because I won't even purchase canned goods at the store it there is even a scratch in the label.

However I think they are still finding a standard with their k-cups. While I believe Cafejo is a quality company who wants to make a quality product, I had a couple of issues with my order:<br />- all the k-cups seemed too weak. They also felt physically lighter then the k-cups I usually use, perhaps due to less actual coffee inside.<br />- Huge issues with the filters inside the cups. On multiple occasions I would go to brew a cup, just to get a quarter inch of coffee with a bunch of coffee grounds in it. Upon removing the k-cup I would find the exit hole clogged with grounds, preventing water flow. It seems like a bad run of k-cups or badly engineered run or something, since I've never had this happen before in 3+ years of doing k-cups.<br /><br />Hopefully they can get these challenges sorted out, as this used to be my favorite brand of coffee. Will try them again in the future.\n","neutral\n","We love 'em. Perfect for tea.

I have bought grains and been given grains from a number of sources over the years. (I occasionally go out of town for a while and need to let the kefir go and then buy new grains) I am changing my review.  I had bought these grains in the past and did not have good results with them.  It made thick keefir, but after a few weeks it was still tasting terrible and cheesy.  I finally threw the grains away.  They did not give me the refund when I told them that the grains were not working out, despite the 'guarantee'. I decided this time- due to the reviews- to give fusion teas another chance.  I got a funny batch, but when I contacted the company and told them what happened, this time they sent more grains.  The new grains make a nice thick kefir with a 24-36hr ferment.  The flavor is balanced and after just two days it is mild enough to drink plain.  It has already started to help my upset stomach.  Thank you to fusion teas for sending these grains. Make sure to use whole milk because it will taste better =)\n","neutral\n","Pro: works!<br />Cons: it's a strong taste, but I got used to.\n","neutral\n","This has a great roasted flavor you don't find in the big two PB brands.

I purchased mine from an Indian grocery store.<br /><br />First, let me say, I often think a product is great till after I've been taking it a week or two. Well, I've been drinking amla juice for about two months and I LOVE it! The taste is bearable (bitter and strange), but what I love is that it completely stopped my hair fall!!! I only get a couple strands on my brush where before my hair was falling out in huge volumes due to genetic middle age hair loss that runs in my family.<br /><br />I had to stop taking a pill supplement due to weird side effects that caused my heart to beat funny. So I looked all over and came across this remedy. Let me tell you, it will keep whatever hair you have on your head! At least it does for me.<br /><br />Another cool benefit from taking this is I could see that it helped my near-sightedness a titch. My vision is a little better even though I still wear my glasses. Also, it took away blurry vision after eating high sugar foods.<br /><br />Hope this review helps. If you have an Indian grocery near you, it's worth the trip.

UPDATE- I emailed the company and they replied with an explanation.  \\\\\"About a year ago, we did make a small change to the liquorice.  The change came into effect after California's Proposition 65.  This proposition states that licorice products can not contain more than a certain level of lead.  Lead is naturally occurring in licorice made with molasses.  Manufacturing has found a different molasses to use to cut the levels of lead down to the very smallest amount.\\\\\"\n","neutral\n","he Best Short Bread cookies ever.\n","neutral\n","These pop-tarts taste great, I should have ordered more.\n","neutral\n","This is a very tasty gluten-free cereal which I've enjoyed for over 10 years.

I tried going paleo for awhile about a year ago, but I didn't stick it out and reintroduced grains into my diet. I felt awful after this but was trying to convince myself that grains were okay.

However, never have I eaten anything as terrible as this. Two weeks ago I considered expanding my meat substitute options so I considered this product.  After reading many of the reviews for the 12-pack case I was tempted to make the purchase as the majority of reviewers considered this to be tasty enough to deserve 4 or 5 stars.  One customers however cautioned that potential buyers consider purchasing a can at a local health food store before making that decision.  This I did thankfully.  I paid $4.99 for the 13 oz can and was excited to eat it with the meal I prepared consisting of: stewed red beans, mashed potatoes, boiled plantain, callaloo and a salad of cucumbers and tomatoes.

Strong delicious mint flavor that really successfully freshens your breath and lubricates your mouth if you sometimes suffer from dry mouth, as I do. Sweet mint flavor then lasts for a good 15-20 minutes without feeling overpowering. Gum stays soft, but not too soft, so it's comfortable to chew. Bottle also lasts about a month and a half for me with pretty frequent chewing throughout the day, and I never really feel like I need to chew more than one at a time. Breath feels fresh and mouth feels clean for several hours afterwards.

These folks take great care in the products they sell.  This is one of my three favorite teas they sell.<br />I found this particular tea when another large tea seller kept being out of my favorite tea that they sold.  Just went to the website and began to read through the tea blends until I found one that was worth trying.  While I usually by tea by the pound the smaller bag option gave me an opportunity to try different flavors.<br /><br />The flavor on this tea is really rich without being over powering. All the ingredients can be tasted, but no one item takes over the flavor.  I appreciate that the tea is mixed pretty closely  to the time of purchase.  Have and the opportunity to communicate directly with sellers and was really pleased with responsiveness.  Having purchased this tea for about two years now, and I find it to be consistently good, fresh and unique.  The flavor is deep and wonderful to savor.  I find that it works best, for me, when I use raw honey.<br /><br />Once nice thing is that the seller often includes a small sample of a different blend of tea.  That has actually led to me trying other teas from Tea Attic.  I actually prefer this purchasing option as opposed to going into the tea store where the lids of containers are taken on and off over and over again. .....\n","neutral\n","poor oil quality. BEWARE the oils is NOT EXTRA Virgin. it is just chepaly heat processed and heat expelled oil. with some soybean oil and cotton seed oil mixed in to lower costs.

On the first try, we followed the package instructions, and found it to be weak. Next we doubled the amount of coffee, brewed in a french press, and judged it average at best, lacking body and robust flavor. Definitely won't replace Seattle's Best #5 as our everyday coffee. Disappointing.\n","neutral\n","I bought this as a gift for my husband. It was a big disappointment. Most of the boxes have one or two small pieces in it (like two almond roca, one chocolate crunch cookie, or two small pieces of fudge). In addition to the misrepresented quantity, the taste of several items was terrible. It was cheap quality and not worth the money. Also, what was listed to be included was not what we received.  I also included a message in the shipping and it was not included in the package, which caused my gift to not make a lot of sense. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again.\n","neutral\n","I love this drink and the cardamom has such a yummy unique flavor.

The only complaint I can make is that it leaves behind a coffee ground residue in the coffee mug, most likely because of the design of the pod.

I was hesitant at first, but oh. My. God. They are DELICIOUS. Holy crap, I could down 3 or 4 of these in a row, they're so good. The only thing I've ever made with chia seeds was a chia pudding from Giada de Laurentis's book (also available on foodnetwork.com) and I loved it, but I've never had chia in any other application. I LOVE the texture chia seeds give things. Mix them with juice and it's like a refreshing fruity pudding. I liken chia seeds to tapioca once they've soaked in liquids overnight. You could probably make this at home, but it's so much easier to buy these and take them with you. Best served cold, though! We will most definitely be buying a few more cases of this flavor in particular.\n","neutral\n","If you LOVE coffee and can not have it for whatever reason Teeccino is<br />as close to the flavor of real Coffee as it gets.<br /><br />No, it doesn't taste exactly like real Coffee, but it is very close and<br />a great substitute.

I was hopeful that the company would have fixed the problem by the time I ordered.  Problem is, there are a 100 k cups in a box all loosely floating around and during shipping they are banging into each other which I'm sure is what the problem is.  If they were tightly stacked in a box, I'm sure that would solve the problem.<br />The coffee is very good though.

I've only been using it for about three weeks, so it probably hasn't been enough time to see if the technique is effective.  I will say that the texture of this coconut oil is very smooth, and it has a very mild taste so I can swish it around my mouth for 20 minutes without feeling the need to gag.

I suffer from a few debilitating pain conditions, and all of the crummy things that come with them - like low energy. After doing a lot of research on what might help I ordered this. It is helping me every time I add it to my super shake that includes, seaweed, powdered veggies & fruits along with a few non-scary ingredients. --- A funny side note too: I know through the study of holistic healing that our skin is our largest organ. So if we want to create positive change we need to put things that are healing on topically too. I came oh-so-close to adding this to a skin cream on a bad day. Yup. I would have been healthier, but a bright magenta too.\n","neutral\n","My husband loves these and I am getting addicted too.\n","neutral\n","The bag was half-filled…<br />I didn't realize it until a friend who bought the same packet asked me why it was half-filled.

They were a day away from throwaway.\n","neutral\n","I lived in New Zealand for a bit over two years and I can tell you, my first taste of WATTIE'S  was simply magic. WATTIE'S is owned by Heinz but the two products aren't alike at all. Heinz is salty and vinegary, while WATTIE'S has a deep, rich, almost sweet spicy flavour that lends itself VERY well to fried potatoes and many other dishes in a different way from Heinz.

The six packages that weren't moldy were just as this jerky should be.\n","neutral\n","I really like these pistachios. They're salted, but just enough salt to taste. Not as heavily salted as some I've suffered through (I don't like really salty nuts), but, like I said, just enough. Otherwise they're very much like every bag of pistachios I've ever purchased.

What's the matter with you people?!  I thought it would be gross after all the negative reviews, but it is good!  The overriding flavor is sweet though, not peanut.

DO NOT BUY.\n","neutral\n","Excellent product and price!\n","positive\n","This sugar has a toffee-ish flavor to me, it goes very well in coffee. I think it is a little less sweet than white sugar, but it is a wonderful substitute. If I am baking with it, I add it to the liquids first and let it sit for about 1/2 hr to let it dissolve, it blends much better that way. I recommend coconut sugar in baking and coffee, but not for a frosting or glaze, the flavor will be too strong. If you are looking to decrease your intake of refined white sugar, I highly recommend switching to coconut sugar! It actually has health benefits, as opposed to white sugar (or even worse- that fake stuff!) which has harmful effects on the body.\n","neutral\n","I was surprised by how good this tea tastes. I'm fairly picky about my tea and coffee. This has a good flavor and is strong enough to suite me without being bitter. I usually put honey in my tea, but this is good with or without it.\n","neutral\n","This was great popcorn, had a really good flavor.\n","positive\n","I like the product.  I wasn't really crazy about the taste (kinda strong), so I put it in my coffee every morning.  Other than that, it was hard for me to find something I liked it with.  Sometimes I just ate a tablesoon really fast then chased with a coke.  It stayed in the pantry at home so I only used it once or twice a day, but I did notice that I was alot more regular, and that is great for me because I have digestive system issues and have had portions of my colon removed, so this product helped in that area! I did not have any weight loss with the 1st bottle, which I was hoping for, but i didn't take it long enough or as frequently for that to happen.  I would like to have another bottle, but it is a little pricey.

Thank you.\n","neutral\n","Lecithin granules are an excellent addition to bread machine bread. By adding several teaspoons to each recipe it has ensured that the bread is moister and resists becoming crumbly a day or two after baking. This means it is possible for me to use &#34;homemade&#34; bread for sandwiches without having to cut the slices very thick, or have the thinner slices fall apart. The fact that I keep a kosher kitchen means that the lecithin, being soy-based, is pareve ( or neutral ) allows me to use it in bread that will be served with meat or dairy product. This has been a very successful addition to my bread. It is well-packaged and at a very reasonable price. The shipping was extraordinarily fast. A great  product, a great price!

My son has a allergy to red dye. It is a shame that these companies think they have to put red dye in food just to add some color. So many children are labeled with anger issues or ADD and are sent to shrinks or just have pills shoveled down there through. When if the parents would just take the red dye out or their kids diet most of them don't even have a problem they are just being poisoned. Red dye has been outlawed in European countries due to the affects on the kids.

I find myself drinking this more now than Earl Grey which is the closest tea I can think of to compare this to.  And certainly not as sugary as the Lychee tea I purchased a while back (which I now dilute on a regular basis).  Recommended.\n","neutral\n","ITO-EN is my absolute favorite tea brand! Their bottled tea are the best; the flavor is concentrated enough that I enjoy it (although sometimes I prefer the Dark Green more than the original) but it doesn't have a bitter taste.

The green label has perforations so that you can easily remove it and refill it.\n","neutral\n","yum  will purchase repeatedly\n","neutral\n","It works!!\n","neutral\n","This ice cream looks and tastes like the world's richest frozen confection. We're not sure if it's the most expensive, but it's worth every penny because it has a wonderfully creamy mouthfeel and delicious authentic flavors. You don't need to eat a lot to feel very satisfied. This is what quality ice cream used to taste like before greedy corporations began making that awful aerated stuff they sell in refrigerated grocery cases. Go ahead and treat yourself to the best instead from eCreamery.\n","neutral\n","I think this is an excellent product which was sent in a timely manner. The reason for not Five Stars is because there was reference to this being suitable for a four-cup coffee maker. These simply did not work in my new four-cup coffee maker. People have used this size before successfully with these coffee maker, but this time it did not work in this new unit. I cannot fault the filter basket entirely as the coffee maker has to be returned as it won't even make coffee.\n","neutral\n","Okay, I hate to give any Torani syrup less than 5 stars. My coffee is that important to me. And Torani is the good ole gold standard. BUT I hate that the sugar-free versions have Ace-K in them. so yes it does save me from being as big as Jabba the Hutt, but it might kill ya too. Not the seller's fault though. Just want everyone to be both mindful and to write Torani until they take that out. -- I like this syrup. Not as much as I thought I would, but having Almond Roca in your head sets a high expectation.\n","neutral\n","wonderful flavor and grinds easily\n","positive\n","I would give it zero stars if I could.

I bought it at Whole Foods for about $7/loaf (still expensive, but cheaper than here).  I also just found out it's sold at Vons for $5/loaf.  But seriously...BEST BREAD EVER!

Great biscuits\n","neutral\n","I got the special offer and agreed to review the coffee in exchange.  Would I buy it again at full price?  Probably not, because I like very dark roasts and this was as another reviewer wrote, Meh.  I wasn't overly impressed.  It is better than the typical names like Folgers, Maxwell House and I even liked it better than Dunkin Donuts coffee.  I prefer a dark Italian Roast or French Roast.  When brewing this coffee, I also now will add some of my darker roast to the Dark Addiction and it's much better.<br />My boyfriend liked this roast just fine, but he  never adds espresso shots to his coffee to deepen the taste like I do.  :)<br />Guess I'm a hard one to please when it comes to coffee.<br />But thanks to the company for the good offer.  That can't be beat.\n","neutral\n","This was recommended by our hospital pediatrician.  We never tried any other formula.\n","neutral\n","Meets my expectations. I use it for making a marinade for jerky. I use a gallon at a time so I cannot tell you if it tastes better or worse than others. When it is mixed as marinade it works just fine.

It was far too runny, not nearly as thick as other syrups.\n","neutral\n","This product seems like an excellent value to me. To my taste (and I do not like really sweet drinks), using a heaping 1/4 teaspoon was good for 2 quarts of KoolAid. I have also tried the sucralose by this company and I would use 1/16 teaspoon pure sucralose per 2 quart KoolAid--therefore, to my taste I would need over 4 times as much of the stevia than the sucralose. When I use up my existing stevia and sucralose, I will buy more of the sucralose from this company. If you like the taste of stevia and you want pure stevia without filler, then I would recommend you try this product.

(there was an explanation for the sediment on the bottle however) I will say there was a better product on the amazon site though - but I will reiterate this product did taste good in the drink - just not eye-appealing.\n","neutral\n","Arrived as promised.

Make sure you follow the instructions to gently reheat (I wrap it in damp paper towels and heat for 30 seconds) or else it WILL fall apart. It is relatively fragile, so if you're buying it at the store, check the package to make sure you're getting non-broken pieces. Also, this is a great deal, since at my local store they're $4.99/package.

So I was really excited that it's available online. Considering how much you get in a bag and how much you actually use in one sitting, this is a great price! I made truffles with the maca and wow! Because I made energy truffles they didn't have added sugar in them but they were delicious. I used Viva Labs cocoa powder and their coconut oil as well with some peanut butter and cayenne pepper and I wound up with a delicious snack. Maca powder isn't sweet, kind of reminds me a of powdered peanut butter. However you can mix it in a bunch of stuff like smoothies, milkshakes and in baked goods. Every time I've eaten it I've found myself not only fuller longer but I also had more energy than I did before.<br />Truffle Recipe:<br />1/2 c. Viva Labs maca powder<br />1/2 c.

It's called &#34;Einsiedehilfe&#34; in Austria and &#34;Einmach-Hilfe&#34; in Germany. Each packet is 2.5 grams of sorbic acid. It does what it's supposed to do; our favorite use is in making &#34;Melissensaft,&#34; a sweetened tea made by prolonged steeping of Lemon-balm; a packet of &#34;Einsiedehilfe&#34; will preserve a few liters of the syrup. It's not easy to find sorbic acid in small quantities; you can of course get it a lot cheaper if you need it by the kilogram. We try to remember to buy some packets when we are in Austria or Germany, but sometimes we forget and sometimes we run out -- availability through Amazon is convenient. For us Austrians and Austro-Americans, it would have been helpful if it had been indexed by both of its commercial names --- at first, I didn't know that Germans called it something else, and I failed to find it.

I usually go for Starburst, but I didn't want the artificial colors. Plus, Starburst flavors are so powerful that they end up hurting my mouth. So I did some research and I found Hi-Chews. I debated for quite some time about this. Should I really spend $11 on some candy? It seems extravagant. What if I don't like it? Needless to say, I bought them. Now my life will never be the same.<br /><br />While these little gems were in transit, I happened to go to the store and saw a small pack of Mamba fruit chews in the check out aisle. In my search for the perfect chewy fruit candy, Mamba and Hi-Chew seemed to be the top contenders. Naturally, I had to snatch up the Mamba right away to try them out.<br /><br />Upon tasting the Mamba, I was terribly disappointed. The orange was good. It resembled an orange Starburst quite a bit. The lemon was so-so. The strawberry was disgusting. I was starting to get concerned that Hi-Chews wouldn't live up to their hype either. But then they were dropped on my doorstep by the mailman.<br /><br />One taste and I was hooked. Every flavor<br />is delicious. If I had to rank them, green apple would be my favorite, then grape, strawberry, and lasty mango. But really, who is playing favorites? These things are just plain good!<br /><br />I'd read some complain that the grape Hi-Chew tasted somewhat like grape medicine. I didn't find they to be true at all. If I had to compare the grape flavor to anything, I'd say it tasted more like grape Hubba Bubba Bubble Tape, which is also<br />amazing.<br /><br />Long story short... I've had my bag of Hi-Chews for exactly one day and I think they're half gone.\n","neutral\n","My son says he would definitely be ordering more of these candies!!

I gave it 2 stars for quick delivery.\n","neutral\n","It doesn't really pack a lot of flavor unless you suck on it, with the \\\\\"smoky chili\\\\\" being way more prominent than the lime. I think they either need to change the way they process the beans or add different seasonings. I prefer 2 Armadillos - specifically their Spicy Cayenne flavor. If you do get that one however, be warned that it has garlic salt or powder in it. It doesn't list it in the ingredients but I can distinctly taste garlic in it.\n","neutral\n","I like the strawberry flavored ones, the grape ones, cherry ones but there were ALOT OF BLUEBERRY ONES, I missed lemon, banana, watermelon...\n","neutral\n","Makes mocha's at home very easy!\n","neutral\n","Just as a bit of background, I've purchased every type of sardines in water that amazon sells. Generally the price of the sardines goes along with the quality fairly consistently with a couple exceptions. This is not one of the exceptions, except that being the least costly sardine sold by Amazon in price per ounce, it's still overpriced.<br /><br />Why two stars? Every now and then one of the tins of sardines is acceptable.<br /><br />My overall experience, and I waited over a month and a half after the purchase to review, is not a good one.<br /><br />1. Upon receiving the box, which was left outside by the delivery person (just a fact, not a complaint), I noted it was a fly attractant. Later I found one of the tins had been damaged and partially opened. Nasty experience for sure, smell-wise as well as what all was attracted to it by the time I found the tin that was open.<br /><br />2. I've never been able to eat a whole tin, just can't stomach them. Even the cats can't go through a whole tin, but every other sardine purchased the cats will eat until the fish are gone. Not these.<br /><br />3. The consistency is poor. The contents of some tins are really nasty, smelling, looking and tasting.<br /><br />4. Some tins are only about half full of sardine it would seem, some are nearly full. Looks like each and every tin gets 3 sardines. I think one tin had 3.5 sardines, but it was kind of hard to tell.<br /><br />So I won't eat these after giving it a fair go and testing several tins over the course of several weeks, but do give them to the cats and frequently take a bite when preparing them for the cats, which I just did again today. As I sit here I'm wondering if I'll need to run to the toilet and puke. Not sure yet but it's not sitting well and only had a really small bite, amazingly the cats seemed to dig into this particular batch.<br /><br />If you ever get confused about what is really food, and what is pure waste product packaged up, don't get these as it will add to your confusion.\n","neutral\n","Very nice\n","positive\n","Awesome!\n","positive\n","Hubby and I are not 100% Paleo, but try to avoid gluten, etc whenever we can. Too many GF options have undesirable ingredients such as cornstarch. He loves bread products so it was nice to find replacement options. While I don't mind using romaine leaves for wraps I figured that my hubby would appreciate these...he does. The only drawback is the price, but purchasing the 49 ct here is less expensive than our local co-op, so I will continue to get them here!\n","neutral\n","I really like this coffee, not bitter, very smooth.\n","neutral\n","My favorite oil to cook with!

Blue Monkey's OK with me. It was on sale for 1.25 per can at WF.\n","neutral\n","Delicious. I have tried this with ground beef, ground chicken, and ground turkey.

Have a few other varieties of this type of sandwich container to compare it to, notably our favorite by Crayola.<br /><br />The plastic used in this container is a harder, flimsier plastic than in all of the others we have, so not sure how long it will last standing up to kids.  Feels like it will crack easily if dropped or pressured in the wrong spot.  Also, lid does not have a tight seal to it, so more likely to wind up with dried out bread.<br /><br />It's not a terrible product, but there are definitely better options out there.\n","neutral\n","I expected these to be spicy, not sweet - they are more sweet than spicy.

I bought this based on the other reviews.  But, I just don't understand how anyone can say that there is no aftertaste with this stuff.<br /><br />There is a very strong bitter aftertaste.  I bought this to try to use with my whipped cream dispenser and my coffee.<br /><br />When I added it to the cream, it would NOT dissolve.  I tried whisk, nope, just chunky pieces.  I put the lid on the the whipped cream dispenser and shook it for a while to see it that would do it, and hoped for the best.  It did dissolve some, but still had &#34;pieces&#34; in it.<br /><br />I tried it in my hot coffee, and it did dissolve in the hot liquid.  But, was horrible.  It was not sweet enough and just very bitter aftertaste.  I tried to add more to make it sweeter, but it never got sweeter, just more bitter.<br /><br />I wonder if I can return It?\n","neutral\n","I made these Sat and added blueberries. Very good!\n","neutral\n","This stuff is delicious! It's great as a cocktail mixer or to make flavored lemonade/iced tea. It comes in a huge bottle that lasts quite a while. Highly recommend.\n","neutral\n","i was coming home from work and walking up the steps to my porch i could smell it before i saw it! that's a good thing! my whole porch smelled like lavender! When cooking/baking with this stuff though, don't put add too much. my sugar cookie recipie called for 3 tbs of flowers but 2 looked like a lot so i stopped there. and even 2 was a lot. my pantry smells pretty now!\n","neutral\n","I love this stuff!  It works great anywhere you need a lime, and I never have to throw away half used limes again.  I especially like this in cocktails and sodas.\n","neutral\n","As stated.\n","neutral\n","Sugar and corn syrup are the leading two ingredients in the package. Hydrogenated oils are next. Then soluble coffee. So, sugar, than oil, than coffee. So, not surprisingly, the coffee flavor is pretty weak. One of the other ingredients is monk fruit, which was new to me. Turns out it's also a sweetner (similar to Stevia - sweetener with few calories). 2 tablespoons are 90 calories, so if you wanted to have a larger cup, your caloric intake will be similar to a regular soda/pop.<br /><br />So if you like sweet lattes, you might enjoy this. If you prefer mostly black or not very sweet coffee, this will definitely not be up your alley.\n","neutral\n","How can you not love jello?  Great gift for an Aggie!\n","neutral\n","It's just really good malted milk powder.  Lots of flavor, but those who depend on their malted milk powder to add sugar as well might be disappointed.  Add your own sugar if you want, because this is the real deal and nothing but the real deal.  And while it's more expensive than some others, you aren't paying for the sugar, so you use less.\n","neutral\n","My baby hasn't tried this yet, as I got it for back up formula in case I cannot pump enough breastmilk when I go back to work.  I just wanted to share that it took about 10 days to arrive, and the expiration date is 12-19-14.  I have high hopes for this formula, as it is ready-to-feed, in BPA free Tetra packs, and one of the healthiest formulas out there (I had used Baby's Only as back-to-work supplement in the past for two older children, and this is supposed to be a step up, although my kids tolerated Baby's Only well.)    UPDATE!  7 month old EBF baby accepted this formula very well (in a sippy cup, not bottle, but she wouldn't take a bottle for expressed breastmilk either).  No tummy troubles.\n","neutral\n","This dressing is fantastic.  I am sure that you could use it on salad but we use it as a marinade when baking chicken.  It gives the chicken a very unique taste and we love it!\n","neutral\n","This was a great buy!

They are very healthy for me.  There is 25 grams of protein in each serving and only 150 calories.  When I eat these a lot, my good chloresterol rises.  They taste very good too.  The 4.5 oounce peice is perfect for a meal.  I don,t have to cook them either.  Just heat them up if I prefer.  They taste good both ways.  I love the lemon dill flavor  Not very often that I find something that tastes good,  is good for me, and is very easy to prepare.  I seem to be eternally watching my weight and trying to stay healthy, and these are perfect for that too.  I have been eating these along with other flavors for four our five years and I will keep on  as long as I can find them.  I can,t seem to find them in the grocery store any more.\n","neutral\n","Great snack for those on a low carb, high protein diet.

I'd highly recommend giving these a try, especially priced as well as they are with Subscribe and Save subscription.\n","neutral\n","Too much salt, so if you buy them, eat them just every once in a while.
